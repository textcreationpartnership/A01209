            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q> Truly the Church is adorned with an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable varietie of excellent documents, ſermons, Treatiſes, Spirituall bookes, all very comely and pleaſant to the ſight, by reaſon of the admirable mixture which the ſunne of Iuſtice makes of his Diuine wiſdome with the tongues of his Paſtours, which are their Penns, and with their Penns, which ſometimes they vſe in lieu of their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, and doe compoſe the rich plumes of this myſticall doue. But amongſt all the diuers colours of the doctrine which she doth publish, the fine gold of holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is eſpecially diſcouered, who makes herſelfe be gloriouſly enteruiewed, gilding all the ſciences of Saints with her incomparable luſter, and rayſing them aboue all other Sciences. All is to Loue, in Loue, for Loue, and from Loue in the holy Church.</p>
            <p>But as we are not ignorant that all the light of the day proceeds from the Sunne, and yet doe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſaie, that the Sunne shines not, ſaue onely when it doth openly ſend out its beames here or there. In like manner though all Chriſtian doctrine conſiſt of ſacred Loue, yet doe we not indiſtinctly
<pb facs="tcp:2765:9"/> honour all Diuinitie with the title of DIVINE LOVE, but onely thoſe parts of it, which doe contemplate the birth, nature, properties, and operations thereof in particular.</p>
            <p>Now it is certaine, that diuers writers, haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably handled this ſubiect; Aboue all the reſt thoſe auncient Fathers, who as they did louingly ſerue God, ſo did they ſpeake diuinely of his Loue. O what a pleaſure it is to heare S. PAVLE, ſpeake of heauenly things, who learn't them euen in Heauen it ſelfe. And how good a thing it is to ſee thoſe ſoules that were nurced in the boſome of Loue, write of its ſweeteneſſe I For this reaſon, thoſe amongſt the ſchoole men that diſcourſed the moſt and the beſt of it, did alſo moſt excell in pietie. S. THOMAS made a Treatiſe of it, worthy of S. THOMAS: S.

               </gap>, Sixtus Senenſis ſpeaks of him in this ſort: He hath ſo worthily diſcourſed vpon fiftie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Diuine Loue, which are drawen here and there out of the Canticles, that he alone may ſeeme to haue hit the number of the affections of Diuine Loue. Verily he was a man exceeding lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, iudicious and deuote.</p>
            <p>Yet that we might know that this kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is performed with more felicitie by the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Louers, then by the learning of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it hath pleaſed the Holy Ghoſt that diuers wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should worke wonders in this kind. Who did euer better expreſſe the heauenly paſsions of
<pb facs="tcp:2765:9"/> heauenly Loue then S. CATHARINE of Genua. S. ANGELA of Folligni, S. CATHARINE of Sienna. S. MATILDA?</p>
            <p>In our age alſo diuers haue wrote vpon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, whoſe workes I haue not had leaſure to read diſtinctly, but onely here and there ſo farre forth as was requiſite, to diſcouer whether this might yet find place. Father Lewes of Granado, that great Doctour of pietie, left a treatiſe of the Loue of God in his Memoriall, which is ſufficiently commended, in ſaying it is his. Stella, a Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can made a very affectiue one, and profitable for Praier. Chriſtoph: Fonceca an Auſtine, put out yet a greater, wherein he hath many excellent things. Father Richeome of the Societie, hath alſo published a booke, vnder the title of the Art of louing God by his Creaturs, and this Authour is ſo amiable in his perſon, and in his ſingular wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that one cannot doubt but he is yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable by writing of Loue it ſelfe. Father Iohh of IESVS MARIA a diſcalced Carmelite, compoſed a little booke, which is alſo called the Art of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, which is much eſteemed. The great and famous Cardinall Bellermine did alſo a while agoe giue into light a little booke intituled, The little Ladder to aſcend vnto God by his creaturs, which cannot be but admirable, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from ſo deuote a ſoule and ſo learned a pen, which hath wrote ſo much, and ſo learnedly in the Church her behalfe.

            <p>Further, we doe ſee a goodlie and magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which the R. Father Laurence Paris, a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine Preacher erected in the honour of heauenly Loue, which being finished, will be a compleat courſe of the Art of louing well. And laſtly the B. Mother Tereſa of IESVS, hath written ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly of the ſacred motions of Loue, in all the bookes she hath left vs, that a man is aſtonished to ſee ſo much eloquence, masked in ſo profound humilitie; ſo great ſoliditie of wit, in ſo great ſimplicitie: and her moſt learned ignorance, makes the knowledge of many learned men appeare ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, who after a great tormoile in ſtudies, blushe, not to vnderſtand that which she ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily puts downe touching the practiſe of holy Loue. Thus doth God raiſe the Throne of his Power, vpon the Theather of our infirmitie, making vſe of weake things to confound the ſtrong.</p>
            <p>And be it, my deare Reader, that this Treatiſe which I now preſent, come farre short of thoſe excellent workes, without hope of euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming

               </gap>re of heauenly Louers, to whom I dedicate it, that it may be ſome wayes ſeruiceable vnto thee, and that there, thou shalt meete with many wholſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which thou shouldſt not elſe where ſo eaſily find, as againe thou maiſt els where find many rare things, which are not here. Yea me thinkes, my deſigne fals not in with theirs, ſaue in generall, in ſo much as the glorie of Diuine Loue is all our aimes. But this you shall know by reading it.</p>
            <p>Truly myne intention was onely, ſimply and nakedly with art or varnish, to repreſent the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the Birth, progreſſe, decaye, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proprieties, aduantages, and excellencies of heauenly Loue. And if beſids all this thou findeſt ſomwhat elſe they are certaine ſuperfluities which are hard for ſuch an one as my ſelfe, who write amidſt many diſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to auoyd. Howbeit I hope, nothing therin shall be without ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Nature her ſelfe, who is ſo skilfull a work wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, proiecting the production of grapes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth withall, as by a certaine prudent inaduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch an abundance of leaues and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, that there are very few vines, which are not in the ſeaſon to be pruined and cut.</p>
            <p>Writers often are handled to harshly, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are made of them being precipitated, ordinarily with more impertinencie, then they practiſed imprudence in taking vpon them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their writings. Precipitation of iudgment doth greatly enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger the Iudges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and the innocencie of the Accuſed: Diuers doe write foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,
<pb facs="tcp:2765:11"/> and diuers alſo doe cenſure groſly. The ſweetneſſe of the Reader, makes his reading ſweete and profitable. And my deare Reader, to haue thee more fauourable, I will here render thee a reaſon of ſome paſſages, which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, otherwiſe put thee out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>Some, peraduenture, may apprehend, that I haue ſaied too much, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it was not requiſite, to bring downe the diſcourſe euen from its heads. But I am of opinion, that heauenly Loue is a Plant, like to that which we call Angelica, whoſe roote is no leſſe odoriferous then the bole, and branches. The 4. firſt bookes, and ſome chapters of the reſt, might without doubt haue bene omitted to the liking of ſuch ſoules as onely ſeake the practiſe of holy Loue, yet all of it will be profitable vnto them if they behold it with a deuote eye, While others alſo might haue diſliked, not to haue had the whole continuance of that which belongs to the Treatiſe of Diuine Loue. Certes I tooke as I ought, into my conſideration the condition of the wits of this age wherein we are. It doth much import one, to know in what Age he writs.</p>
            <p>I cite the Scripture, ſometimes in other termes, then are found in the vulgar Edition. O good God, my deare Reader, doe me not therefore the wrong to thinke, that I would goe from that Edition: ah no; for I know the Holy Ghoſt hath authoriſed it by the Holy Councell of Trent, and that therefore all of vs ought to ſtick to it: but contrariwiſe I make no other vſe of the other verſions, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:2765:11"/> to ſerue this, when they explicate and confirme the true ſenſe therof. For example. That which the heauenly Spouſe ſaieth to his Spouſe, THOV HAST WOVNDED MY HEART, is wonderfully cleared by the other verſion, THOV HAST TAKEN AWAY MY HEART, or, THOV HAST SNACHED AWAY, AND RAVISH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>D MY HEART. That which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaieth, BLESSED ARE THE POORE OF SPIRIT is much amplified and declared, by the Greeke, BLESSED ARE THE BEGGARS OF SPIRIT, and ſo of others.</p>
            <p>I haue often cited the ſacred Pſalmiſt in verſe, and it was done to recreate thy mind, and through the facilitie which I found in it by reaſon: of the ſweete tranſlation of Philipe de Portes, Abbot of Tiron, which notwithſtanding I haue not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely followed; yet not out of any hope I had to be able to doe better then this famous Poet. For I should be too impertinent, if, neuer hauing ſo much as thought of this kind of writing, I should pretend to be happie in it; in an age and condition of life, which would oblige me to retire my ſelfe from it, in caſe I had euer bene engaged therein. But in ſome places where the ſenſe might be diuerſly taken, I followed not his verſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not follow his ſenſe; as in the Pſ. 132. where he hath taken a latin word, for the fringe of the garment, which I apprehended, was to be taken for the coler, wherevpon I tranſlated it to myne owne mind.</p>
            <p>I haue ſaied nothing which I haue not learn't of others: yet it is impoſsible for me to remember whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I had euery thing in particular; But beleeue
<pb facs="tcp:2765:12"/> it, if I had drawen any great peeces of remarke out of any Authour, I would make a conſcience not to let him haue the deſerued honour of it; and to deliuer you of a ſuſpition which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue againſt my ſinceritie in this behalfe, I giue you to know, that the 13. Chap. of the 7. booke, is extracted out of a Sermon which I made at Paris at S. IOHN'S in Greue, vpon the feaſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our B. Ladie. 1602.</p>
            <p>I haue not alwayes expreſſed how one Chapter followes another, but if you marke, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily find the connection. In that and diuers other things I had a care to ſpare myne owne labour, and your patience. After I had cauſed the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a deuote to life be printed, my Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishope of Vienna, Peter villars, did me the fauour to unite his opinion of it, in termes ſo aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to me, and that little booke, that I dare neuer reheaſe it; and exhorting me to applie the moſt of my leaſure to the likes workes; amongſt many rare aduiſes wherewith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me, one was, that as farre forth as the matter would permit, I should be short in the Chapters. For euen as, quoth he, the Traueller knowing that there is a faire Garden ſome twentie or twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie fiue pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es out of his way, doth eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, for ſo ſmall away, to goe ſee it, which he would not doe, if it were further diſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen ſo one that knowes that there is but a little diſtance betwixt the beginning and end of a Chapter, doth willingly vndertake to read it, which he would not doe, though the ſubiect were neuer ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if a long time were required to the reading of
<pb facs="tcp:2765:12"/> it. And therefore I had good reaſon to follow myne owne inclination in this reſpect, ſince it was agreeable to this great Perſonage, who was one of the moſt ſaintly Prelats, and learned Doctours that the Church had in our age, and who, at the time that he honored me with his letter, was the moſt auncient of all the Doctors of the Facultie of Paris.</p>
            <p>A great ſeruant of God aduertiſed me not long a goe, that by addreſſing my ſpeache ſtill to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothie in the Introduction to a deuote life, I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered many men to profit by it; for that they did not eſteeme the aduertiſſements made to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, worthy of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I admired that there were men, who to be thought men, did showe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo little men, in effect. For I leaue it to your conſideration, my deare Reader, whether deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not as well for women as men; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weare not to read the ſecond epiſtle of S. IOHN with as great attention and reuerence which was addreſſed to the holy Ladie Electa, as the third which he directeth to Caius: and whether a thouſand thouſand Epiſtles, and Treatiſes of the auncient Fathers of the Church ought to be held vnprofitable to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that they are addreſſed to holy women of thoſe times. But againe, it is the ſoule which aſpires to deuotion that I call Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothie, and men haue ſoules as well as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe to imitate the great Apoſtle in this occaſion who eſteemed himſelfe lyable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, I changed my addreſſe in this Treatiſe, and ſpeake to THEOTIME: but if peraduenture
<pb facs="tcp:2765:13"/> there should be any women (and ſuch an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie would be more tolerable in them) who would not read the inſtructions which are made to men, I beſeech them to know, that THEOTIME, to whom I ſpeake, is mans ſpirit deſiring to make progreſſe in holy Loue, which is as well in men as in women.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe then is made for a ſoule alreadie deuote, to aduance her in her deſigne; and for this cauſe, I haue bene forced to ſpeake many things leſſe knowen to the common ſort, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will appeare obſcure: The bottome of a ſcience is alwayes hardeſt to be founded; and few Diuers are found, who will, or knowes how to diue for Pearles, or other precious ſtones in the middeſt of the Ocean. But if you haue a free heart to diue into this writing, it will truely happen to you as to Diuers, who, ſaieth Plinie, being in the deepeſt gulfe of the Sea, clearely diſcouer the light of the Sunne. For you shall find euen in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt places of this diſcourſe, a good and amiable light. And verily as I doe not follow thoſe who diſpiſe certaine bookes, which treate of a life ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent in perfection, ſo would I not ſpeake of this ſupereminencie. For neither can I cenſure the Authours, nor yet authoriſe the cenſures of a doctrine which I vnderſtand not.</p>
            <p>I haue touched many points of Diuinitie; not with a Spirit of contradiction, but ſimply propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, not ſo much what long agoe I learned in the ſchooles, as that which the care I haue had of ſoules, and the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of 24. yeares I haue ſpent in preaching, hath made me apprehend to be moſt
<pb facs="tcp:2765:13"/> to the glorie of the Ghoſpell and the Church.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, diuerſe men of note from diuerſe places haue ſignified vnto me, that certaine little Pamphlets haue bene publiſhed, vnder the onely firſt letters of their Authours name, which light to be the very ſame with myne; which made ſome beleeue that they were my workes not without touch of ſcandall to ſuch as apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thereby that I had bidden Adieu to my wounted ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to puffe vp my ſtyle with words of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my diſcourſe with vaine conceits, and my conceits with a loftie and plumed eloquence. For this cauſe, my deare reader I will tell thee, that as ſuch as graue or cut in precious ſtones, hauing their ſight dazled by keeping it continually fixed vpon the ſmall ſtikes of their worke, doe will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hold before them ſome faire Emerald, that by beholding it from time to time, they may be recreated in it's greeneſſe, and relieue their weakned ſight. So in this Preſſe of buſineſſe, which my function dayly drawes vpon me, I haue ſtill ſome proiects of certaine treatiſes of pietie, which at my leaſure I looke vpon, to reuieue and vnwearie my mind.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, I doe not profeſſe my ſelfe a writer; for the dulneſſe of my ſpirit, and the condition of my, life, expoſed to the ſeruice and approch of many, would not permit me ſo to be. Wherefore I haue written very little, and yet haue published leſſe, and to complie with the Councell and will of my friends, I will tell thee what I haue written to th'end that thou maiſt not attribute the praiſes of another mans labours to him, who of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:2765:14"/> deſerues them not.</p>
            <p>It is now 19. yeares agoe, that being at Thonon a little towne ſituated vpon the Lacke of Geneua, which by little and little began at that time to be conuerted to the Catholike faith. The Miniſter, Enemye of the Church, cryed all vp and downe, that the Catholike Article of the Reall Preſence of our Sauiours bodie in the Euchariſt, did diſtroye the Symbole and the Analogie of Faith (for he was glad to mouth this word ANALOGIE not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of his Auditours, that he might appeare learned) and vpon this the reſt of the Catholike Preachers, with whom I was, preſſed me to write ſome thing in refutation of this vanitie; I did what ſeemed fitting, framing a briefe meditation vpon the Creede to confirme the Truth, and all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were diſperſed in this Dioceſe, where now I find not one of them.</p>
            <p>Soone after his Highneſſe came ouer the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and finding the Bailiwike of Cablaies, Gaillard, and Ternier, which are about Geneua, well diſpoſed to receiue the Catholike faith, which had bene banished thence by force of warrs and reuoults, about 70. yeares paſt, he reſolued to reeſtablish the exerciſe thereof in all the Parishes, and to abolish the exerciſe of Hereſie: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the one ſide this great Happineſſe had many obſtacles, according to the conſiderations, which are called reaſons of ſtate, and yet on the other ſide, diuers, as yet not well inſtructed in the truth, made reſiſtance againſt this ſo much deſired eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, his Highneſſe ſurmounted the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie by the inuincible conſtancie of his Zeale
<pb facs="tcp:2765:14"/> to the Catholike Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie ſweetneſſe and prudence. For he made the chiefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moſt obſtinate be called together, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made a ſpeach vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſo louely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d preſsing an eloquence that in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner being all vanquished by the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his fatherly loue towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depoſed the armes of their obſtinacie at his feete, and their ſoules into the hands of the Church.</p>
            <p>Licence me my deare Reader, I praye thee, to ſpeake this worde by the by, one might praiſe many rich actions of this great Prince, amongſt which I ſee the proofe of his vnſpeakable valour, and militarie knowledge, which he makes now admired through all Europe. But for my part, I cannot ſufficiently extoll the eſtablishment of the Catholike Religion in theſe three Bailiwikes, which I haue euen now mentioned, hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in it ſo many markes of pietie ſuted with ſo great a varierie of actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie, Magnanimitie, Iuſtice, and mildneſſe. Me thought, I diſcerned in this little Peece, as in an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all that is praiſed in Princes, who haue in times paſt with moſt feruour ſtriuen to aduance Gods an the Church her glorie. The ſtage was but little, but the actions long. And like as that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Artiſt was neuer ſo much prized for his great Peeces, as he was admired for making a shipe of Yuorie, ſtored with all her furniture, in ſo little a forme, that the wings of a bee did couer it: So I eſteeme more that which this great Prince did at that time, in this ſmall corner of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, then many more ſpecious actions, which others extoll to the heauens.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:2765:15"/>
            <p>Now by this meanes the victorious enſignes of the Croſſe were replanted in all the wayes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke places of thoſe quarters: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whereas a little before, there had bene one erected very ſolemnely at Ennemaſſa neare vnto Geneua, a certaine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made a little treatiſe againſt the honour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, containing a sharpe and venimous inuectiue, to which therefore it was deemed fit to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: And my Lord Claudius de Granier my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour, whoſe memorie is in benediction, did impoſe the burthen vpon me, according to the power which he had ouer me, who beheld him not onely as my Bishope, but alſo as a holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God. I made therefore this anſwere vnder this Title, A Defence of the Banner of the Croſſe, and dedicated it to his Highneſſe, partly to teſtifie vnto him my moſt humble ſubmiſsion, and partly to render him ſome ſmall thanksgiuing for the care which he tooke of the Church in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Now a while agoe this Defence is reimprinted vnder the prodigious tittle of PANTHALOGIE, or Treaſure of the Croſſe: a Title whereof I neuer dream't, as in truth I am not a man of that ſtudie and leaſure, nor yet of that memorie, to be able to put together ſo many peeces of worth in one booke as it might beare the name of TREASVRE, or PANTHALOGIE, beſids that I abhorre ſuch inſolent Frontiſpices.</p>

            <p>In the yeare 1602. the obſequies of the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Prince Philipe Emanuel of Loraine,
<pb facs="tcp:2765:15"/> Duke of Mercurie, who had done ſo many braue exploits vpon the Turke in Hungarie, that all Chriſtianitie was bound to conſpire to honour his memorie, were celebrated at Paris, I being there. But aboue all the reſt, Lady Marie of Luxembourg his widowe, did for her part all that her heart, and the Loue of the dead could ſuggeſt vnto her, to ſolemnize his funeralls. And becauſe my Father, my Grand Father, and great Grand Father, had bene brought vp Pages to the moſt illuſtrious and moſt excellent Princes of Martigues, his Father, and Predeceſſours, she eyed me as an hereditarie ſeruant of the houſe, and made choice of me to make the funerall Sermon, in this ſo great a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britie, where there were not onely diuers Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls and Prelats, but certaine Princes alſo, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Marshalls of France, knights of the Order, yea and the Court of Parleament in Bodie. I made then this funerall Sermon, and pronounced it in this ſo great an aſſemble, in the great Church of Paris; And for ſo much as it contained a true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the heroicall feats of the deceaſed Prince. I did eaſily cauſe it to be imprinted at the requeſt of the widowe-Princeſſe, whoſe requeſt was to me a law. Now I dedicated that Peece to Madame the Ducheſſe of Vandome, as yet a girle, and a very young Princeſſe, yet one, in whom was alreadie apparently ſeene, the ſtraines of that excellent vertue and pietie, which at this day shine in her, worthy of the extraction and and breeding of ſo denote and pious a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>While this Sermon was in the preſſe, I heard
<pb facs="tcp:2765:16"/> that I was made Bishope, ſo that I came preſently hither to be conſacrated, and to begin my Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and vpon it, was propoſed vnto me how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie it was to aduertiſe the Confeſlariouſes of ſome important points: for this reaſon I wrote 25. aduertiſments, which I cauſed to be printed, to get them more eſily diſperſed amongſt thoſe to whom I directed them, but ſince, they haue bene reimprinted in diuers places.</p>
            <p>Three or foure yeares after I put out the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a deuote life, vpon the occaſion, and in the manner which I haue put downe in the Preface thereof touching which I haue nothing to ſaie to thee, my deare Reader, ſaue onely, that though this little booke haue generally had a gracious and gentle acceptance, yea euen amongſt the moſt graue Prelats and Doctours of the Church, yet eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped it not the rude cenſure of ſome, who did not meerely blame me, but bitterly taunted me in publicke, for that I tell Philothe that daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is an action indifferent in it ſelfe, and that for recreations ſake one may make Quodlibets; and I kowing the manner of theſe cenſures, I praiſe their intention, which I thinke was good. Yet should I haue deſired, that they had pleaſed to haue conſidered, that the firſt propoſition is drawen out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and true doctrine of the moſt holy and learned Diuines, which I put downe for ſuch as liue in the world, and Court: that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I doe carefully incultate the extreame dangers which are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in dauncing: and touching the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition it is not myne, but that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable king's S. Lewis, a Doctour worthy to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb facs="tcp:2765:16"/> in conducting Courtiers to a deuote life. For I beleeue, if they had weighed this, their Charitie and diſcretion had neuer permitted their Zeale, how rigorous and auſtere ſoeuer, to haue armed their indignation againſt me.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, my deare reader, I coniure thee to be gracious and fauorable vnto me in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Treatiſe: and though thou shouldſt find the ſtyle a little (and a little onely I aſſure my ſelfe it shall be) different from that which I vſed in writing vnto Philothie, and both of them much different from that which I vſed in the defence of the Croſſe, know that in nine-teene yeares one learnes and vnlearnes many things; that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the warrs differs from that of Peace, and that a man vſeth one manner of ſpeach to young Prentiſes, an other to old iorneymen.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is here to ſpeake to ſoules that are aduanced in deuotion; for you muſt know, that we haue in this towne a congregation of young maides and widowes, who being retired from the world, doe liue vnanimouſly in God's ſeruice, vnder the protection of his moſt holy mother; and as their pietie and puritie haue often times giuen me great conſolations, ſo haue I ſtriuen to returne them the like, by a frequent diſtribution of the holy word, which I haue announced vnto them, as well in publike ſermons, as in ſpirituall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, yea and that continually in the preſence of diuerſe Religious men, and people of great pietie, whence I was often to treate of the moſt delicate feelings of pietie, paſsing beyond that which I had ſaied vnto Philothie. And I owe a good
<pb facs="tcp:2765:17"/> part of that which now I communicate vnto thee, to this bleſſed aſſemblie, becauſe she that is the mother of them, and doth rule, knowing that I was writing vpon this ſubiect, and yet that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was I able to accomplish it without Gods very ſpeciall aſsiſtance, and their continuall ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she tooke a continuall care, to praie and make me be praied for to this end, and holily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured me to gather together all the odde ends of leaſure which she iudged might be ſpared here and there from the preſſe of my incumbrances, and to employe them in this. And becauſe I beare a great reſpect to this good ſoule, she had, God knowes, no little power to animate myne in this occaſion; I began indeede long agoe, to thinke of writing of holy Loue, but that thought came farre short of that, which this occaſion cauſed to be produced, an occaſion which I declare vnto you ſo nakedly, and ſincerely, to the imitation of the Auncients, that you may know that I wite onely vpon occaſion, and that I may find you more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable. The Pagans held, that Phidras neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented any thing ſo perfectly as the DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITIE; nor Apelles, as Alexander. One is not alwayes alike happie; If I fall short in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, let thy goodneſſe flie home; and God bleſſe thy reading.</p>
            <p>To this end I haue dedicated this worke to the Mother of dilection, and to the Father of cordiall Loue, as I dedicated the Introduction to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Child, who is the Sauiour of Louers and the Loue of the ſaued. Certes, as women while they are ſtrong and able to bring forth their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:2765:17"/> with eaſe, chooſe commonly their worldly friends to be their Godfathers. But when their feebleneſſe and indiſpoſition makes their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie difficile and dangerous, they inuoke the Saints of Heauen, and vow to make their children be chriſtned by ſome poore bodie, or by ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote perſon in the name of S. IOSEPH, S. FRANCIS OF ASSICIA, S. FRANCIS OF PAVLA, S. NICHOLAS, or to ſome other of the Bleſſed, who may obtaine of God their ſafe deliuerie, and that the child may be borne aliue. So I, while I was not yet Bishope, hauing more leaſure and leſſe apprehenſion to write, I dedicated my little works to Princes of the earth; but now being ouercharged with my charge, and hauing a thouſand impediments. I conſecrate all to the Princes of Heauen, to th'end they may obtaine for me the lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus, my deare Reader, I beſeech God to bleſſe thee, and to enrich thee with his loue. Meane while from my very heart I ſubmit all my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, my words and actions to the correction of the moſt holy Catholike, Apoſtolike, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Church, knowing that she is the Pillar, and ſoliditie of truth, wherein she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor deceiue vs; and that none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue God for his Father, who will not haue this Church for his Mother.

Be pleaſed therefore to know, that our Authour, being one of the greateſt Diuines of his tyme in France, ſpeakes now and then in ſchoole tearmes
<pb facs="tcp:2765:27"/> and formalities, which our English will ſcarcely beare, eſpecially in the higheſt and hardeſt matters of diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as predeſtination, the Trinitie &amp;c. And againe I deſired, that ſo worthy an Authour, should rather be heard ſpeake in his owne words, then in my tranſlation, eſteeming FAITH, not SMOOTHNESSE the grace therof. Hence as farre forth as the language would permit, I haue ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his owne words, turning BOVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE Bountie (ſaie the like of diuers other words) which notwithſtanding in the rigour of the ſchoole, should often rather haue bene turned GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE, as being the obiect of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Will Hence alſo, AMITIE I haue tranſlated, friendship, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the approued cuſtome of the ſchooles, should rather haue bene turned, LOVE, in the 212. pag. where
<pb facs="tcp:2765:27"/> it ſignifieth the holy Ghoſt. But the learned Reader, will fauorably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate them according to the matter, and not reproue ſuch words as neceſſitie, or fidelitie, made me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, though they haue not yet gotten ſo free and knowen courſe in our English tongue. If I put for the reſt of the faults, in ſenſe or words, myne owne little skill, and leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and for the faults in the print (eſpecially comma's, which as they are frequent, and ſerue diuers times for parentheſes, ſo being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or diſplaced, in lieu of clearing, they violate, or at leaſt trouble the ſmoothneſſe of the periode) the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters totall ignorance in the tongue (ſo that he will put as ſoone, TVB for, but, as BVT) my excuſe will be as full and entire, as ſincere. Some of the cheife faults you may find

An Armie is then ſaied to be Faire, when it is compoſed of partes ſo ranged in order, that their diſtinction is reduced to that proportion, which they ought to haue together for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2765:30"/> of one onely armie. That Muſicke be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the voices muſt not onely be neate, cleare, and well diſtinguiſhed, but alſo ſo combined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them ſelues, that thereof be made a due Sound and Harmonie by meanes of the Vnion which is in Diſtinction, and the Diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is in the Vnion of voices: which is not vnfitly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an According Diſcord, or rather, a Diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Accord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now as the Angelicall S. THOMAS, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the great SAINT DENIS, ſaieth excellently well, Beautie, and Goodneſſe, though in ſome thing they agree, yet are they not for all that one, and the ſame thing: for Good is that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the appetite, and will; Faire that which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the vnderſtanding or knowledge: or elſe, Good is that, whoſe fruition delightes vs; Faire that, whoſe knowledge is agreeable vnto vs. For which cauſe in proper ſpeach, we doe neuer attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute corporall Beautie, but to obiects of two ſenſes, which are the moſt capable, and moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to the vnderſtanding, to wit ſight, and hearing: ſo that we doe not ſaie: behould Faire odours, or Faire ſauours: yet doe we cuſtomari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaie behould Faire voices, and Faire colours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faire, then being called Faire, becauſe the knowledge therof doth delight, it is requiſite that beſides the Vnion, and Diſtinction of Integritie, Order and Conueniencie of parts; there be alſo Splendor, and Light in abundance, to the end that it may be intelligible, and viſible. Voices to be Faire, muſt be cleare, and neate; diſcourſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; colours, glittering and shining; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2765:30"/> shades, and darkeneſſe are deformed and doe disfigure all things: becauſe in them, nothing is intelligible; neither Order, Diſtinction, Vnion nor Conueniencie: which cauſed S. DENIS to ſaie, that God as Soueraigne Beautie, is author of the faire Conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, Luſter, and Good Grace, which is found in all things, making appeare in forme of light, the diſtributions and diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his rayes; by meanes wherof, all things are made faire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, that for the eſtablishment of Beautie, there should be, Conueniencie, Light, and Good Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Certes THEOTIME, Beautie is without effect, vnprofitable, and dead, if Light, and Splendor, should not giue her life, and efficacie; whence we terme colours liuelie when they haue light, and luſter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But as touching animated and liuing things, their Beautie is not compleate without a Good Grace, which addes to Conueniencie of perfect parts, wherin Beautie conſiſteth, Conueniencie of Motion, Geſture, and Action, which are as the life, and ſoule of Beautie in liuing things: ſo in the ſoueraigne Beautie of our Lord God, we doe acknowledge Vnion, yea vnitie of eſſence, in the diſtinction of perſons, with an infinite Light, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an incomprehenſible Concurrence of all the perfections of actions and motions, ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely compriſed, and as one would ſaie, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ioyned and added in the onely, and moſt ſimple perfection of the pure diuine act, which is God himſelfe, immutable, vnuariable, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where we will shew.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:2765:31"/>6. God therfore hauing a will to make all things Good and Faire, reduced the multitude, and diſtinction of the ſame, to a perfect Vnitie, and as man would ſaie, brought them all, to a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, making a ſubordination of one thing to an other, and of all things to himſelf, the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Monarch. He diſgeſted all the members into one bodie, vnder one head: of many perſons, he formes a Familie: of many Families, a Towne: of many Townes, a Prouince: of many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, a Kingdome; putting the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnder the gouernement of one onely King: ſo THEOTIME, amongſt the innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and varietie of actions, motions, feelings, inclinations, habits, paſsions, faculties, and powers which are in man, God hath eſtablished a naturall Monarchie in the will, which doth rule, and command all that is found in this little world. And God ſeemes to haue ſaied to the will, as Pharao ſaied to Ioſeph: Thou shalt gouerne my houſe, all the people shall obaye thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; without it none shall moue. But certes this power of the will is practiſed in a farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Certes the will doth gouerne the power of our exterior motions as a ſeruant, or ſlaue: for vnleſſe ſome externall thing doe hinder, they are neuer deficient in obedience. We open, and shut our mouth, moue our tongue, our hands, feete, eyes, and all the members, wherin the motion of this power is conuerſant, without reſiſtance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our wish and will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But as for our ſenſes, and touching the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritiue, Augmentatiue and Generatiue Faculties, we cannot with like eaſe gouerne them, but we muſt imploy therin induſtrie, and arte. If a ſlaue be called, he comes; if he be willed to ſtaie, he ſtaies; But we muſt not expect this obedience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Sparrow-hauke, or Faulcon; he that deſires she should returne to the hand, muſt shew her the lewre; if he would keepe her quiet, he muſt hood her. We bid our boy turne to the right or left hand, and he does it; but to make a horſe turne ſo, one muſt make vſe of the bridle; We muſt not THEOTIME command our eyes not to ſee, our eares not to heare, our hands not to touch, our ſtomacke not to digeſt, or our bodie not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or breede; for theſe faculties not being intelligible, are not capable of obedience. None can adde a cubite to his ſtature. RACHEL deſired, but could not conceiue. We eate often without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2765:32"/> nourishment, or grouth; he that will preuaile with theſe powers, muſt vſe induſtrie. A Phiſition which hath to doe with a Child in the cradle doth neuer command him any thing: but onely giues order to the Nource to appointe ſuch and ſuch things, or elſe peraduenture he preſcribs, that she shall eate this or that meate, take this or that potio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which diſperſing it's qualities in the milke, and the milke in the childes bellie, the Phiſition doth acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish his will in this little weakling, who hath not euen the power to thinke of it. It is not the way verily to impoſe abſtinence, ſobrietie, or continencie vpon the palate, ſtomacke, or bellie; but the hands muſt be commanded not to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the mouth meate and drinke, but in ſuch, and ſuch a meaſure; we muſt keepe short the power which doth adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the objects, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſubiects, and take away the nourishment which doth forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, as reaſon shall require. If we deſire our eyes should not ſee, we muſt diuert, or couer, and shut them vp in their naturall hoode, and by theſe meanes, one may bring them to the point which the will aimes at. It is thus THEOTIME that our Sauiour ſaieth, there are ſome, which are ſuch for the Kingdome of heauen, that is, which are not ſuch by naturall impotencie, but by a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, which the will vſeth to containe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of holy continencie. It were follie to command a horſe that he should not waxe fat, that he grow not, that he should not kicke; to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all this, and to breake him; one muſt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, but his prouender.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The will doth alſo exerciſe a certaine kind

It is true she cannot manage, or range them ſo abſolutely as she doth the hands, feete or tongue, by reaſon of ſenſitiue faculties (namely the Fantaſie, which doth not obaye the will with a prompt, and infallible obedience) which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the operations of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Memorie: notwithſtanding the will doth moue, imploy, and apply theſe faculties at her pleaſure, though not ſo firmely and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the light and variable Fantaſie, doth not often diuert, and diſtract them, ſo that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cries out, I doe not the good which I deſire, but the euill which I hate, ſo we are often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to thinke not the good which we loue, but the euill which we hate.</p>

AVGVSTINE ſaieth, is called in vs ſinners concupiſcence, and remaines ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the will, and Vnderſtanding, as the wife to her Husband, becauſe as it was ſaied to the woman; Thou shalt returne to thy Husband, who shall gouerne thee; ſo was it ſaied to Cain, that his appetite should returne home to him, and that he should maiſter it: And no other thing is ment by, Returne to man, then to ſubmit, and ſubiect it ſelfe vnto him. O man ſaieth S. BER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARD, it is in thy power if thou wilt, to bring thine enemy ſo to be thy ſeruant, that all things should ſucceede well with thee: Thy appetite is vnder thee, and thou shalt dominere ouer it. Thy enemy can moue in thee, the feeling of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is in thy power, to giue or refuſe conſent; In caſe thou permit thy appetite to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thee away to ſinne, then thou shalt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and it shall dominere ouer thee; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſinneth is made ſlaue to ſinne; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſinne, ſo long as ſinne getteth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into thy conſent, but onely into thy ſenſe, that is to ſaie, ſo long as it ſtaies in the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, not goeing ſo farre as thy will, thy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is ſubiect vnto thee, and thou Lord ouer it. While an Emperour is not yet created, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Electors Dominion, in whoſe hands it is to reiect, or elect him to the Imperiall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but being once elected and eleuated by their meanes, from thence they begin to be his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and he their Lord. So long as the will denies conſent, she preſides: but hauing once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <p n="2">2. To conclude, this ſenſuall appetite in plaine truth, is a rebellious ſubiect, ſeditious and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and we muſt confeſſe we cannot ſo defeate it, that it doth not riſe againe, encounter and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the reaſon: yet hath the will ſuch a ſtrong hand ouer it, that she is able if she pleaſe, to bridle it, breake it's deſignes, and repulſe it, ſyth that not to conſent to the ſuggeſtions therof, is a ſufficient repulſe. One cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concupiſcence to conceiue; yet well may we ſtaie it, from bringing foorth and accomplishing ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now this concupiſcence or ſenſuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, hath 12. motions, by which as by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mutinous Captaines it raiſeth ſedition in man. And becauſe ordinarily they trouble the ſoule, and diſquiet the bodie: in ſo much as they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſoule, they are called perturbations: in ſo much as they diſquiete the bodie, they are named paſsions, as witneſſeth S. AVGVSTINE. All place before them ſelues, Good, or Euill, that, to atchiue it, this, to auoyde it. If Good be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe according to it's naturall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it excites Loue, the prime and principall paſsion: If Good be repreſented as abſent, it prouokes a deſire of it ſelfe: it being deſired, we apprehend it poſsible, it enters in vs a Hope; if impoſsible, Diſpaire begins to ſeaſe vs. But when we enioie it as preſent, it moues vs to ioie. Contrariwiſe as ſoone as we diſcouer Euill, we Hate it: if it be abſent, we flie it: if we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2765:34"/> propoſe it as ineuitable, we Feare it; if we think we can eſchew it, we doe emboulden, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our ſelues: But if we feele it as preſent, we Greeue; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anger, and Indignation, ſodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runnes out to reſiſt, and repulſe the Euill, or at leaſt to be reuenged of it. Which if it ſucceede not according to our mind, we remaine in Griefe. But if we repell, or be reuenged of it, we feele ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and content, which is a Pleaſure of Triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe, for as the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Good, doth glad the heart, ſo the victorie ouer Euill, doth ſatiate the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And ouer all this multitude of ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuall paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the will beares Empire, reiecting their ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, repulſing their embracements, hindring their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: or at the very leaſt ſtifly denying them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, without the which, they can neuer endamage vs, and by refuſall of which, they remaine van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished; yea euen a farre off weakned, deiected, defeated, repreſſed, and if not altogether ſlaine, at leaſt mortified and brought lowe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And THEOTIME, this multitude of paſsions is permitted to reſide in our ſoule for the exerciſe of our will in vertue, and ſpirituall vallour. In ſo much that the STOIKES who denied that paſsions, were found in wiſe men, did greatly erre, and ſo much the more; for that they shewed in effect, that which in words they denied, as S. AVGVSTINE shewes, recounting this pleaſant hiſtorie. AVLVS GELIVS hauing embarked himſelfe with a famous STOIKE, a great tempeſt takes them, whereat, the STOIKE being affrighted begun to waxe white, and Pale, and ſenſibly to Tremble, ſo that all in the boate perceiued it, and tooke preciſe notice
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2765:34"/> of him, albeit they did runne the ſame hazard with him. In the interim the ſea waxed calme, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger paſſed, and aſſurance did reſtore to eche of them Libertie to blame, yea euen to raile at him: A certaine voluptuous ASIATIKE gybed at the STOIKE and reproched vnto him his Feare, which had made him become white, and Pale by appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger, whilſt he for his part remained firme without Feare, to which the STOIKE replyed, by relation of that which ARISTIPPVS a SOCRATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL Philoſopher had anſweared one, who for the ſame reaſon had quipped him with the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch: ſaying vnto him, for thee, thou hadſt no reaſon to be troubled for the death of a wicked Raſcall: but I should haue wronged my ſelfe not to haue feared to looſe the life of an ARISTIPPVS. And the beſt of it is, that AVLVS GELIVS an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe recites the ſtorie: but touching the STOIKES reply contained therin, it did more commend his wit, then his Cauſe, ſythens, alleaging a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Feares, he left two proofes, by two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochleſſe witneſſes, that STOIKES were touched with Feare, and with Feare which doth leaue it's effects in the Eyes, Face, and Countenance, and is conſequently a Paſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Ah greate follie! to wish to be wiſe, by a wiſdome which is not poſſible. Truely the Church hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned the Follie of this wiſdome, which certaine preſumptuous ANCORITS would haue long agoe introduced, againſt which the whole Scripture, but eſpecially the great APOSTLE crieth out: That we haue a law in our bodie, which reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the law of our mind.

And THEOTIME it is the like, touching all other paſsions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: for they doe all flow from loue, as from their ſource and roote.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For which cauſe the other paſsions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are good, vitious, or vertuous, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Loue whence they proceede is good or bad; For Loue doth ſo bedewe them with her owne qualities, that they ſeeme to be no other then very Loue it ſelfe. S. AVGVSTINE reducing all theſe paſſions to foure as did alſo BOETIVS, CICERO, VIRGIL with the greateſt part of the Auncients, Loue ſaieth he, tending to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that he loues, is termed Concupiſcence, or Deſire: hauing and poſſeſſing it, t'is called Ioie: flying that which is contrarie to him, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Feare: but if Loue perceiue it arriued, he puts on the name of Griefe, and conſequently theſe paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are Euill if the Loue be Euill, Good if it be Good. The Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie Citie doe Feare, Deſire, Greeue, Ioie, and becauſe their loue is iuſt, all their affections are alſo iuſt. Chriſtian doctrine doth ſubiect the Reaſon to God, to th'end he should guide and ſuccour it; and to the Reaſon all the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that it may bridle and moderate them;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2765:36"/> ſo that they might be conuerted to the ſeruice of iuſtice and vertue. The rectified will is the good loue, the diſordred will, is the euill loue: That is to ſaie in a word THEOTIME, Loue hath ſuch dominion ouer the will, that he makes her iuſt ſuch as he is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The wife doth ordinarily change her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into that of her Husband, becoming noble, if he be noble; Queene, if he be King: Dutches if he be Ducke. The will doth alſo change her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, into that of Loue which she eſpouſeth; if he be carnall, she becomes carnall, if ſpirituall, she turnes ſpirituall: and all the affections, Deſire, Ioie, Hope, Feare, Griefe, as iſſues of the mariage, betwixt Loue and the will, doe conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their qualities fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Loue; to be short THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIME the will is not moued but by her affections, amongſt which, Loue as the PRIMVM MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BILE and prime affection, giues motion to all the reſt, and cauſeth all the other motions of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor doth it follow hence, that the will doth not alſo rule ouer Loue, ſeeing that the will doth not Loue, but in willing to Loue, and that of the diuerſitie of Loues, which preſent them ſelues, she can apply her ſelfe to which she liſt, otherwiſe, Loue would neither be prohibited nor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. She is then Miſtreſſe ouer Loues, as a Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>felle ouer her Suters, amongſt which she may make election of whom she pleaſeth. But as after the mariage, she looſeth her libertie, and of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe becomes ſubiect to her Husbands power; remaining taken, by him whom she tooke, ſo the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2765:36"/> will which at her owne pleaſure made election of Loue, after she hath embraced any one, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſubiect to him. And as the wife is ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Husband which she hath choſen, ſo long as he shall liue, doth after her Husbands death regaine her precedent libertie, to marrie an other: ſo while one Loue liues in the will, it reignes there, and the will is ſubiect to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but if this Loue come to die, she can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take an other. And againe, there is a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the will which a wife hath not; and it is, that the will can reiect her Loue at her pleaſure, by applying her vnderſtanding to motiues, which makes it diſguſtfull, and by vndertaking, to chainge the obiect: For in this manner to make the diuine Loue liue, and reigne in vs, we ought to mortifie Proper Loue; if we cannot altogether annihilate it, at leaſt we muſt weaken it in ſuch ſort, that though it liue, yet it doe not reigne in vs. As contrariwiſe in forſaking Diuine Loue, we may adheare to that of creaturs, which is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous adulterie, wherewith the Diuine Loue doth ſo often reproch ſinners.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THere is no leſſe motion in the Intellectuall or Reaſonable appetite, which is called the will, then there is in the Senſitiue or Senſuall: but thoſe are cuſtomarily named Affections, theſe Paſſions. The Philoſophers and Pagans did in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2765:37"/> ſome ſort loue God, their Common wealth, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Sciences: they hated Vice, aſpired after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, expected not to eſcape Death, or Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, were deſirous of knowledge, yea euen of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude after Death. They did encourage them ſelues, to ſurmount the difficulties, which did croſſe the way of Vertue, dreaded Blame, fled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Faultes, reuenged publicke Iniuries, diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Tyrants, without any proper intereſt. Now all theſe Motions were ſeated in the Reaſonable part, ſyth that neither the Senſes, nor conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly the Senſuall appetits are capable of application to theſe obiects, and therefore theſe Motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were Affections of the Intellectuall, or Reſonable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, not Paſsions of the Senſuall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How often doe we feele Paſsions in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetite of deſires, contrarie to the Affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which at the ſame time we perceiue in the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable appetite, or will. The young man mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by S. HIEROME did fairely with his teeth cut of his tongue, and ſpet it in the face of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed woman, which inflamed him to carnalitie: did he not teſtifie therby an extreame Affection of Diſpleaſure in his will, contrarie to that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pleaſure, which by force she made him feele in his Concupiſtible, or ſenſible Appetite? How often doe we tremble amidſt the dangers, to which our will brought vs, and makes vs remaine? How often doe we Hate the Pleaſure, wherin the ſenſuall appetite delightes it ſelfe, and Loue the Spirituall good wherin it is diſguſted? In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſteth the warre, which we daiely experience betwixt the Spirit, and Flesh: betwixt our exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2765:37"/> Man, which depends of Senſe, and our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, which depends of Reaſon: betwixt the old Adam which followeth the appetits of his EVE or Concupiſcence, and the new Adam, which doth ſecond heauenly wiſdome, and holy Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The STOIKES as S. AVGVSTINE, deliuers, denying that a wiſe-man hath Paſſions, doe confeſſe notwithſtanding as may Appeare, that he had affections which they termed EVPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIES, or Good Paſſions, or elſe CONSTANCIES with CICERO: for they ſaied, the wiſeman did not Couit, but will onely; was not Light of heart, but Setledly ioyefull; that he had no Feare but onely a Foreſight and Precaution; ſo that he was not moued but by Reaſon, and according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for this cauſe they peremptorily denied that a wiſe-man could euer be Sorrowfull, that being cauſed by preſent Euill, whereas no Euill can befale a wiſe-man; ſyth that, no man is hurt but by himſelfe, following their MAXIME. And certes THEOTIME they did not amiſſe to holde that EVPATHIES, or Good Affections reſide in the Reaſonable part of man, but they erred much in auerring, that there were no Paſſions in the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue part, and that Sorrow did not touch a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart: For omitting what they them ſelues had experienced in this behalfe (as hath bene tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) by this meanes they might conclud that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might depriue one of Mercy, which is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſorrow, touching our hearts, and working the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a deſire to deliuer our neighbour from the euill which he endureth. Nor doth EPICTETES, the beſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt the Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s follow this errour; that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2765:38"/> Paſsions, doe not make Inſurrections in a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as S. AVGVSTINE doth witneſſe, showing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the diſſenſion of STOIKES, and other Philoſophers about this ſubiect, was but a meere diſſenſion in words, and ſtrife in language.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now the Affections which we feele in Our reaſonable part, are more or leſſe Noble and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, according as their Obiect is more or leſſe Sublime, and as they are in a more eminent degree of the mind: for ſome of them proceede from the Diſcourſe which we make, following the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Senſe; others are formed by a Diſcourſe drawne from Humane Sciences; others riſing from a Diſcourſe which is made according to Faith, and finally there are ſome which haue their Origin from the ſimple Taſte and Repoſe, which the Soule, hath in Veritie, and the will of God. The firſt, are called Naturall affections: For who is he that doth not naturally deſire Health, commoditie of Meate, Drinke, and Cloth, Sweete and Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conuerſation? The ſecond, are named Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as being altogether founded vpon the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Knowledge of Reaſon, by which our will is excited to ſeeke the Tranquillitie of the minde, morall Vertues, true Honour, a Philoſophicall Contemplation of heauenly things. The third ſort of Affections, are termed Chriſtian, becauſe they iſſue from Diſcourſe deriued from the Doctrine of our Sauiour Chriſt, which cauſeth in vs a Loue of voluntarie Prouertie, perfect Chaſtitie, the Glorie of Heauen: But the Affections of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preeme degree are inſtiled Diuine, and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, becauſe God himſelfe doth poure them into
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2765:38"/> our hearts, and they ayme at, and tend to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of any Diſcourſe, or naturall Light, as it is eaſie to conceiue; and we will hereafter ſpeak of the Reſtes, and guſtes which are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Sanctuarie of the ſoule. And theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Affections are principally three: the Loue of the mind towards the beautie of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of faith: a Loue towards the profit of things promiſed vs in the other life; and a Loue towards the ſoueraigne Bountie of the thrice holy and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Diuinitie.</p>

But this laſt borne inherites all the authoritie: and Selfe-loue as an other ESAV is deputed to his ſeruice, and not onely all the other motions of the Soule, as his brethren doe adore, and are ſubiect vnto him, but alſo the Vnderſtanding, and will, which are to him as Father, and Mother.

               <p n="4">4. And be it, there are other ſupernaturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſoule, Feare, Pietie, Force, Hope, as ISAAC, and BENIAMIN, were Supernaturall children of RACHEL, and REBECCA: yet is diuine Loue ſtill Maiſter, Heire, and Superiour, as being the Sonne of promiſe: ſyth that in vertue of it, heauen is promiſed to man.

               <head>A deſcription of Loue in generall. <hi>CHAPTER VII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe wil hath ſo great a ſympathie with Good, that as ſoone as she perceiues it, she turnes towards it, to pleaſe her ſelfe therin, as in her deſired obiect, to which she hath ſo neerely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed her ſelfe, that one cannot euen declare her Nature, but by the reference she hath to it: like as one cannot shew the nature of Good otherwiſe, then by the Affinitie it hath with the will: For tell me THEOTIME what other thing is Good, then that which euery one doth will. And what is the will, if not the facultie which beares vs forward, and makes vs tend to Good, or that which the will eſteemes ſuch?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The will then perceiuing, and feeling Good, by the help of the Vnderſtanding propoſing it, feeles at the ſame time, a ſuddaine delight, and complacence vpon it, which doth ſweetly, yet powerfully moue and incline her towards this amiable obiect, with intention to be vnited ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, and moues her to ſearch the meanes moſt proper to attaine this Vnion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The will then hath a ſtrict affinitie with Good, this affinitie doth produce the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which the will doth taſte in feeling, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing Good: this complacence doth moue and prick forward the will to Good: this motion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2765:40"/> tends to Vnion, and and in fine the will put in motion and tending to Good, doth ſearch all meanes requiſite to atchiue it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And truely generally ſpeaking, Loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth all this together; as a faire Tree whoſe Roote is the Sympathie which the will hath to Good; the Bole is the Complacence; her Motion, the tope; the INQVESTS, PVRSVITS; and other Endeauours, are her Branches; but Vnion and Fruition, are her Fruits. So loue, ſeemes to be compoſed of theſe fiue principale parts, vnder which a number of other little peeces are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; as we shall find in the proceſſe of this worke.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let's conſider I praye you, the exerciſe of an inſenſible Loue betwixt the ADAMANT and IRON, being a true repreſentation of ſenſible, and voluntarie Loue, of which we ſpeake. IRON then hath ſuch a Sympathie with the ADAMANT, that as ſoone as it is touched with the vertue therof it turnes towards it, this done ſodainely it begins to ſtirre, and quiuer with a little hopping, teſtifying in that, the Complacence it takes, and thervpon it doth aduance, and beare it ſelfe towards the ADAMANT, ſtriuing by all meanes poſsible to be vnited vnto it. And doe you not ſee all the parts of a liuely Loue repreſented in this lifeleſſe ſtone?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to conclud THEOTIME, the Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and Motion, or Effuſion of the will vpon the thing beloued, is properly ſpeaking, Loue, yet ſo as that the Complacence, is but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Loue, and the Motion or Effuſion of the heart which enſues, is the true eſſentiall Loue: ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2765:41"/> that th'one and th'other, may truly be named Loue, but in a diuerſe manner: for as the breake of day, may be termed day; ſo this firſt Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the heart in the thing beloued, may be called Loue, becauſe it is the firſt impreſsion of loue. But as the true Heart of the day begins onely from day-breake, to the ſonne ſetting: ſo the true eſſence of Loue doth conſiſte in the motion, and current of the heart, flowing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Complacence, and ending it's courſe in Vnion: To be short, Complacence is the firſt ſtirring, or motion which Good cauſeth in the will, and this motion is followed by a lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or effuſion wherby the ſoule doth runne and approache towards the thing beloued, which is the true and proper Loue. Let's ſaie thus: Good doth touch, ſeaſe vpon, and engaige the heart by Complacence: but by Loue, it doth draw, conduct, and conueigh it to it ſelfe: by Complacence, it makes the heart vndertake the iourney; but by Loue, doth accomplish it. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, is the awaker of the heart: but Loue, the operation; Complacence giues the Alarum, but Loue cauſeth the March. The heart diſplayes his winges by Complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; but Loue, is it's Flight. Loue then to ſpeake diſtinctly and preciſely, is no other thing then the motion, courſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of the heart, towards the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many great perſonages haue bene of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Loue was no other thing then Complacence it ſelfe, in which they followed a faire ſemblance of reaſon: For not onely the motion of Loue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2765:41"/> takes her origine, from the Complacence which the heart feeles at the firſt approach of Good, and ends in a ſecond Complacence begotten in the heart by Vnion with the beloued: but further it keeps companie with that Complacence, not being able to ſubſiſt without her, who is his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Nource: ſo that, as ſoone as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence ceaſeth, Loue ceaſeth. And as the Bee is bred in the honie, feed of honie, flyeth not abrode but for honie: ſo Loue is borne of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, maintained by Complacence, and tends to Complacence. The poyſe of things doth ſway, moue, and ſtaie them; t'is the waight of the ſtone that doth ſtirre and moue it to diſcent; it is the ſame waight that makes it continew motion after the externall impreſsion be ended; and finally it is the ſame waight, that makes it ſtop and ſtaie as ſoone as it hath attained it's Center: ſuch is the nature of the Complacence which moues the will, she it is that moues, and she that makes the will repoſe in the Vnion of the thing beloued. This motion of Loue then hauing her birth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, and perfection dependantly of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, and being alwayes inſeparably adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto her; it is no maruell that theſe braue wits eſteemed Loue and Complacence the ſame thing, though indeede, Loue being a true Paſſion of the mind, it cannot be a ſimple Complacence, but muſt needes be a motion proceeding from it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now, this motion cauſed by Complacence dures till the Vnion or Fruition, and therefore when it tends to a preſent Good, it hath no other effect then to put forwards, apply, ioyne, and look
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2765:42"/> the heart to the thing beloued, which by this meanes it enioyes, and thervpon is called Loue of delight, or Complacence, becauſe as ſoone as it is begotten of the firſt Complacence, it ends in the ſecond, which it receiues in being vnited to it's obiect. But when the Good towards which the heart is turned, inclyned, and moued is diſtant, abſent, or that ſo perfect an vnion cannot yet be made as is deſired, then the motion of Loue by which the heart doth tend, aſpire, and make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this abſent obiect, is properly named De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, For deſire is no other thing then an appetite, luſt, and coueting of things aymed at, but not yet obtained.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There are yet certaine other motions of Loue; by which we deſire things that we neither hope for, nor pretend in any ſort, as when we ſaie, why am I not now in heauen! I wish I were King; I would to God I were Younger; I wish I had neuer offended, and the like. Theſe indeede are deſires, but imperfect ones, which in proper ſpeach as it ſeemes, might de called wishes; and indeede theſe affections, are not expreſſed in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Deſires, for when we expreſſe our true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we ſaie I Deſire; but when we ſignifie our imperfect Deſires, we ſaie, I should or I woud Deſire; we may well ſaie I would Deſire to be young, but we doe not ſaie, I Deſire to be young, ſeeing that this is not poſſible; and this motion is called a halfe Deſire, or as the Schoolemen terme it a Velleitie, which is nothing elſſe but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Deſire without effect, for that the will perceiuing that she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not attaine vnto that obiect
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2765:42"/> by reaſon of impoſſibilitie or extreeme difficultie, she ſtops her motion, and ends it in this ſimple af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Velleitie, as though she should ſaie, this Good which I behould and cannot Hope for, is truely very agreeable vnto me, and though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not will or Hope for it; yet ſo my affection ſtands, that if I could will or Deſire it, I would willingly Deſire, and will it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To be short theſe halfe conceiued Deſires or Velleities, are onely a little Loue, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Loue of ſimple approbation, becauſe without all pretention the ſoule approues the Good she knoweth, and wanting meanes to Deſire it in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, she proteſteth she would willingly Deſire it, and that it is truely to be Deſired.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nor is this all THEOTIME, for there are Deſires and Velleities which are yet more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then thoſe we haue ſpoaken of, for ſo much as their motions are not ſtaied by reaſon of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie or extreeme difficultie, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſſibilitie they haue with other Deſires or wishes more powerfull, as when a ſickeman De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to eate MVSHROMES, which though he haue at his will, yet will he not for all that eate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring therby to impare his Health: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d who decernes not two Deſires in this partie? th'one to eate MVSH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROMES, th'other to be cured; but becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Health is greater, it doth block vp a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the other in ſuch ſort, as it can produce no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. IEPHTE had a Velleitie to conſerue his daughter, but this not being compatible with a Deſire he had to keepe his Vow, he made an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction contrarie to his Velleitie, to wit, to ſacrifice
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2765:43"/> his daughter, and had a halfe wish or Velleitie, of that which he deſired not, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his daughter. PILATE and HERODE had Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leities, th'one to diliuer out SAVIOVR th'other his PRECVRSOR: but becauſe this was incompatible, the one with a Deſire to pleaſe the IEWES, and CAESAR: the other HERODIADAS and her daughter, theſe wishes were vaine and fruitleſſe. Now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the things incompatible with that which we would are leſſe amiable, the Velleities are leſſe perfect, ſyth they are ſtopped, and as it were ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by ſo weake oppoſits. So the wish which HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROD had not to beheade S. IOHN was more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, then that of PILATS, to free our SAVIOVR. For the one feared the calumnie, and indignation of the people; the other to contriſtate one ſole woman.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Velleities which are hindred, not by impoſsibilitie, but by incompatibilitie with ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Deſires, are called indeede Deſires but vaine, ſtifled and vnprofitable ones. Following the Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leitie of things impoſsible, we ſaie, I would but cannot. And following the Velleitie of things poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, we ſaie, I wish but I will not.</p>

But they did farre miſſe the marke who beleiued that Reſemblance was the onely Conueniencie, which produced Loue: For who knowes not that cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie old men, doe tenderly and dearely loue little infants, and are reciprocally loued of them; that the wiſe, loue ſuch as are ignorant, if they finde them docile; and the ſick, their Phiſitions. And if we may draw any argument from the image of Loue, which is found in things without ſenſe, what reſemblance can draw the Iron, towards the Adamant? hath not one Adamant more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with an other, or an other ſtone, then with Iron of a diuerſe kind? and though ſome to reduce all Conueniencie to a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, would aſſure vs that Iron drawes Iron: and the Adamant, the Adamant: Yet are they to ſeeke for their reaſon, why the Adamant doth more powerfully draw Iron; then Iron doth Iron it ſelfe. But I pray you what ſimilitude is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Lime, and water? or betwixt water, and a Sponge? and yet both of them drinke water with a quenchleſſe deſire, teſtifying an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue inſenſible Loue towards it. T'is the like of humane loue: For ſometimes it takes more

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie then which cauſeth Loue doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſiſt in Similitude, but in the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reference; and correſpondance betwixt the Louer, and the Beloued: And to this effect, it is not reſemblance which moues the ſickmans affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Doctour, but a correſpondance of the ones neceſsitie with the others ſufficiencie, for that the one can afford the aſſiſtance, which the other ſtands in neede of; as againe the Doctour loues the ſickman, knowing him to be his patient, as vpon whom he hath power to exerciſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie: the olde man loueth children, not by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie, but for that the great ſimplicitie, feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and tenderneſſe of the one, doth exalt and make more apparant the prudence and aſſurance of the other, and euen this diſſimilitude is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: on the other ſide, children loue olde men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee them buiſie and carefull about them, and that by a ſecret inſtinct they perceiue they haue neede of their directions. Muſicall concord ſtands in a kind of diſcord, in which vnlike voices doe correſpond, making vp altogether one ſole Cloſe of proportion, as the diſſimilitude of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, and flowres, doe make the gratefull compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Imboſture and Diaprie, ſo Loue is not cauſed alwayes by Reſemblance, and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, but by Correſpondance, and Proportion, which conſiſteth in this, that by the vnion of one thing to another, they may mutually receiue one anothers perfection, and ſo be bettered. The head doth not reſemble the bodie, nor the hand the

But when this mutuall Correſpondance meetes with ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Loue without doubt is engendred more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly: for Similitude being the true picture of Vnitie, when two like things are vnited by a proportion to the ſame end, it ſeemes rather to be an Vnitie, then an Vnion.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe great Salamon in a delitiouſly admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ayre, doth ſing our Sauiours loues, and thoſe of the deuote ſoule, in that diuin worke, which for it's excellent ſweetneſſe is inſtyled the Canticle of Canticles. And to rayſe our ſelues in a more eaſie flight, to the conſideration of this ſpirituall loue, which is exerciſed betwixt God and vs, by the correſpondance which the motions of our hearts haue with the inſpirations of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, he makes vſe of a perpetuall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the loues of a chaſte Shepheard, and shamefaſt Shepheardeſſe. Now (making the Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe or Bride firſt begin the parlie by manner of a certaine ſurpriſe of loue) he makes her at the firſt onſet lance out her heart in theſe words; let him deigne me a kiſſe of his mouth. Doe you marke THEOTIME how the ſoule perſonated by this She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheardeſſe, doth prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no other thing by the firſt expreſsion of her deſire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a chaſt vnion with her ſpouſe, proteſting that it is the higheſt ayme of her ambition, and onely thing she breathes after: For I pray you what other thing would this firſt ſigh intimate? Let him deigne me with a Kiſſe of his mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Kiſſe, from all ages as by naturall inſtinct, hath bene imployed as a repreſentation of perfect loue, that is the vnion of hearts; and not without
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2765:45"/> cauſe: we ſend out and muſter the paſsions and motions, which our ſoule hath common with brute beaſts by our eyes, eye-browes, forehead and countenance; in generall by his face a man is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaieth the Scripture; and Ariſtotle giuing a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ordinarily great mens faces onely are pourtrated, t'is ſaieth he, that the countenances teach what they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet doe we not vtter our diſcourſe, nor the thoughts which proceede from the ſpirituall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſoule called reaſon, (by which we are diſtinguished from Beaſts) but by words; and in conſequence by helpe of the mouth: in ſo much that to poure out ones ſoule, and ſcatter ones heart, is nothing elſe but to ſpeake, Poure out your hearts before God ſaieth the PSALMIST, that is, expreſſe and turne the affections of your hearts into words: And SAMVEL'S pious Mother pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her praiers, allthough ſo ſoftly, that one could hardly diſcerne the motion of her lips: I haue poured out (ſaieth she) my heart before God: in this wiſe, one mouth is applyed to another in kiſsing, to teſtifie that they deſire to poure our one ſoule into the other, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to vnite them in a perfect vnion, and for this Reaſon in all times, and amongſt the moſt ſaintly men the world had, the kiſſe hath bene a ſigne of loue and affection: and ſuch vſe was vniuerſally made of it amongſt the auncient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as the great S.

               <p n="1">1. VVE are neuertheleſſe to vnderſtand, that there are naturall Vnions, as thoſe of Similitude, Conſanguinitie, and the Cauſe with the effect; and others which not being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, may be termed voluntarie; for though they be according to nature, yet are they not made, but by our will as thoſe which riſe from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2765:47"/> benefits, and doe vndoubtedly vnite him that receiues them to the giuer, thoſe of Companie, Conuerſation and the like. Now Naturall vnion produceth Loue, and that Loue being produced, inclines vs to another Voluntarie vnion perfecting the naturall: ſo the Father and the Sonne, the Mother and Daughter, or two Brothers being ioyned in an Naturall vnion, by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame blood, are excited by this V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to Loue; and by that Loue are carried to the Vnion of the will, and the minde which may be called Voluntarie; becauſe allbeit her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is naturall, yet is her action deliberate, and in theſe Loues produced by Naturall vnion, we muſt looke for no other correſpondence then Vnion it ſelfe, by which nature preuenting the will, doth oblige her to approoue loue, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Vnion which she hath already made. But for Voluntarie vnions, they being after Loue in Effect, yet are his Cauſe, as being his onely end and pretention; ſo that as Loue tends to V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo Vnion againe doth extend, and augment Loue; for Loue begets a deſire of conuerſation, and conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth nourish and encreaſe Loue: Loue cauſeth a deſire of nuptiall vnion, and this Vnion doth reciprocally conſerue, and dilate Loue; ſo that in euery ſenſe, it is true that loue tends to vnion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But to what kind of Vnion doth it tend? Did you not note THEOTIME that the ſacred Spouſe did expreſſe her deſire of being vnited to her Spouſe by a kiſſe? and that a kiſſe doth repreſent the ſpirituall vnion which is cauſed by the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2765:47"/> communication of hearts? true it is that man loueth, but by his will, and therefore the end of his Loue is of the nature of his will; but his will is ſpirituall, and conſequently the vnion which Loue pretends is alſo ſpirituall, and ſo much the rather for that the heart, ſeate, and ſource of Loue, should not onely not be perfected by vnion with corporall things, but euen become more vile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will not hence be inferred, that there are not certaine paſsions in man, which as Gumme, or Miſſel to vpon trees, by manner of excrement and ouergroth, ſproute vp amongſt and about Loue, which notwithſtanding are neither Loue nor any part therof, but excrements, and ſuperfluities of the ſame: which are ſo farre from an aptitude to maintaine or accomplish Loue, that it doth enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and weaken it: and in time if they be not weeded away, doe vtterly ruinate it. See the reaſon hereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. According to the multitude of operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (be they of the ſame, or of a diuerſe Nature) to which the ſoule doth applie her ſelfe, she performs them leſſe perfectly, and vigorouſly: becauſe she being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite her actiue vertue is alſo finite, ſo that furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her actiuitie to diuerſe operations it is neceſſarie that each one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue leſſe therof; ſo that one atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue to diuerſe things, is leſſe inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in euery of them; It is not poſſible that one should at the ſame time exactly diſcerne the feature of the face by the eyes; and by the eare diſtinguish the harmonie of an excellent muſique; nor at the ſame inſtant be attentiue to figure, and colour. If our affection be to talke, our attention is for no other thing.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:2765:48"/>5. Yet am I not ignorant what is ſaied of CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, nor incredulous of that which ſo many great perſonages aſſures vs of ORIGIN; that they could apply their attentions at the ſame time to diuerſe obiects. Yet euery one doth confeſſe, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure, in which they were applyed to many, they were leſſe in euery one of the ſame; there is then a difference betwixt to ſee, heare, and vnderſtand much; and to ſee, heare and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand better: For he that ſeeth better, ſeeth leſſe; and he that ſeeth more, ſeeth not ſo well; t'is rare that he who knowes much, knowes that well which he knoweth; becauſe the vertue, and force of the vnderſtanding, being ſcatered vpon the knowledge of diuerſe things, is leſſe ſtronge and vigourous, then when it is reſtrained to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of one onely obiect. Hence it is that when the ſoule imploies her forces in diuerſe operations of Loue, The actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo diuided is leſſe vigorous. We haue three ſorts of actions of Loue, the ſpirituall, reaſonable, and Senſitiue: when Loue lets runne his forces through all theſe three operations, doubtleſſe it is more Extenſe, but leſſe Intenſe: but when it runnes through one operation onely; it is more Intenſe, though leſſe Extenſe. Doe we not ſee that fire, the Symbole of loue, forced to make way by the onely mouth of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, makes a prodigious flashe, which had bene much leſſe, if it had found vent by two or three paſſages: ſythence then that Loue is an acte of our will, he that deſires to haue it not onely noble, and generous, but alſo very vigorous and actiue, muſt containe the vertue, and force of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2765:48"/> it, within the limits of ſpirituall operations, for he that would applie it to the Senſitiue operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ſoule, should ſo farre fourth weaken the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall, in which eſſentiall loue conſiſteth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The auncient PHILOSOPHERS attained to the knowledge of two Extaſes, the one wherof did place our ſelues aboue our ſelues: the other deiected vs, and ſet vs below our ſelues; as though they would haue ſaied, that man was of a Nature betwixt Angels and Beaſts; in his intellectuall part, participating the Angelicall Nature; and in his ſenſitiue the Nature of Beaſts; and yet that he could by good moderation of life, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall care had of himſelfe, deliuer and infranciſe himſelfe of this meane condition, ſo that applying and exerciſing himſelfe frequently in Intellectuall actions, he might bring himſelfe nearer to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels then Beaſts: but if he did much applie himſelfe to Senſible actions, he made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from his midle condition to that of beaſts. And becauſe an Extaſie is no other thing then a going out of ones ſelfe, whether one goe vpwards, or downewards, he is truely in an Extaſie. Thoſe then that touched with intellectuall and diuine pleaſures; doe permit their heart to be rauished with thoſe touches, are truly out of them ſelues, that is, aboue the condition of their Nature, but by a bleſſed and wishfull departure, by which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a more noble, and eminent eſtate, they are as much Angels by the operation of their ſoule, as men by the ſubſtance of their Nature, and are either to be inſtiled Humane Angels, or Angelicall men. On the contrarie ſide, thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2765:49"/> that enticed with ſenſuall pleaſurs giue them ſelues ouer to the enioying of them, deſcend from their middle condition to the loweſt of brute Beaſts, and merit as well to be called Brutall by their operations, as men by Nature; vnhappie to be out of themſelues, for no better end then to enter into a condition infinitly vnworthy of their naturall eſtate and calling.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now according as the Extaſie is more great, either aboue or below vs; by ſo much it doth more hinder the ſoule to returne to her ſelfe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce contrarie operations to the Extaſie in which she is; ſo thoſe Angelicall men which are rauished in God and heauenly things during their Extaſie, doe quite looſe the vſe of the attention of ſenſe; motion and all exteriour actions, becauſe their ſoule, to th'end she may applie her vertue and actiuitie more entirely and attentiuely to that diuine obiect, doth retire and withdraw it, from all her other faculties wholy to deturne them from thence. And in like manner, brutish men rauished by ſenſuall pleaſure, (eſpecially by that of ſenſe in generall,) doe wholy looſe the vſe of reaſon and vnderſtanding, becauſe their miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoules, to haue a more entire and attentiue guſt of their brutall obiect, doe diuert themſelues from ſpirituall operations, to giue themſelues with more vigour to brutall and beſtiall ones: myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imitating herein the one, HELIAS taken vp in the fierie Chariot to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of Angels; th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther NABVCHODONOSOR debaſed to the ranke of brute beaſts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence then I ſaie, that when the Soule pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2765:49"/> Loue by actions of ſenſe, ſo that she is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried below her ſelfe, it is impoſsible that therby the exerciſe of her Superiour loue, should not be ſo much the more weakned: In ſuch ſort that true and Eſſentiall loue is ſo farre from being ayeded, and conſerued by the vnion to which Senſuall loue tends, that it is impared, diſsipated, and perisheth therby. IACOBS Oxen plowed the ground as long as the idle Aſſes fed by them, eating the paſture dew to the labouring Oxen. As long as the Intellectuall part of our ſoule, is employed in honeſt vertuous loue vpon any obiect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy therof; it comes to paſſe often times that the ſenſes and faculties of the inferiour part tend to their proper vnion, and graiſe thervpon, though Vnion be onely due vnto the Heart and Soule, which alone is able to produce true and Subſtantiall Loue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. HELISEVS hauing cured NAMAN the SYRIAN, pleaſing himſelfe in the obligation he had put vpon him refuſed the gold, money, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moueables which were offered him. But his truſtleſſe ſeruant IESSE running after him, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and tooke againſt his Maiſter pleaſure that, which he had refuſed; Intellectuall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cordiall loue, which either is, or should be the Maiſter of our Heart, doth refuſe all ſorts of corporall, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Vnions, and is contented with good-will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the powers of the Senſitiue part which are, or should be the Hand-maids of the Spirit, doe demande, ſeeke after, and take that which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon refuſed, and without her leaue doth make after their abiect, ſeruile, and dishonorable loues,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2765:50"/> as another IESSE violating the puritie of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters intention, to wit the Spirit. And in what proportion the Soule doth conuert her ſelfe to ſuch groſſe Vnions: in the ſame she doth diuert her ſelfe from the delicate, Intellectuall, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall vnion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. You ſee then planely THEOTIME that theſe Vnions which tend to Senſible Complacence and paſsions, are ſo farre from producing, or conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Loue, that they doe greatly hurt, and render it extreamely weake. So when the inceſtuous AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON, who languished, and died as it were in the Loue of THAMAR had once arriued at theſe Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuall and Brutall Vnions, his heart was ſo robbed of Cordiall loue, that neuer after he could endure to ſee her: but with indignitie pushed her out, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating no leſſe cruelly the Right of loue, then he had impudently ſtained that of blood.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Baſill, Roſmarie, Marigouls, Iſope, Cloues, Camimell, Nutmeygs, Lemmans, and Muske put together and incorporated, doe yeeld a truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull odour by the mixture of their good ſmells; yet not nigh that of the water which is thence diſtilled, in which the ſweetes of all theſe Ingredients ſquiſed from their bodies, are mixed in a more excellent manner: meeting to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp of a moſt perfect odour, which doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the ſenſe of ſmelling farre more liuely then it would, if together with the waters the bodies of the Ingredients were found mingled, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; So loue may be found in the Vnions of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall powers, mixed with the Vnions of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall powers, but neuer ſo excellently, as then,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2765:50"/> when the ſole Heart and Courage abſtracted from all corporall affections, vnited together, doe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and Spiritualize Loue. For the ſent of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by ſuch mixture, is not onely ſweeter, and better, but more liuely, actiue, and ſolide.</p>
               <p n="12">12. True it is, that many hauing ruſtike, earthy, and vile hearts, doe put a rate vpon Loues, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pieces of gold: where the moſt maſsiue and weightie are the beſt, and moſt currant; for ſo their opinion goes, that Brutish loue is more ſtrong becauſe it is more violent, and turbulent: more ſolide becauſe more groſſe, and terreane: greater becauſe more ſenſible, and rough: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe Loue is as fire, which by how much more it's matter is delicate, by ſo much the flames are more cleare and faire, which cannot be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguihed then by depreſsing them, and couering them with earth, for in like manner, by how much more abſtract and ſpirituall the ſubiect of loue is, by ſo much his actions are more liuely, ſubſiſtent, and permanent: nor is there a more eaſie way to ruinate it, then by proſtituting it to vile and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reane actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The difference as S. GREGORIE ſaieth betwixt ſpirituall and corporall pleaſurs, is, that corporall ones beget a deſire before we obtaine them: and being obtained, a diſguſt; but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ones contrariwiſe, bring diſguſt before we haue them: and being had, pleaſure: ſo that bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall loue which thinkes by the Vnion which he maketh with the Beloued, to perfect and crowne his deſires, finding that to the contrarie, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroieth them in ending them, is left in diſguſt of ſuch Vnion. Which moued the great Philoſopher
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2765:51"/> to ſaie that almoſt euery beaſt after the enioying of his moſt ardent and preſsing corporall pleaſure remaines ſad, mournefull and aſtonished: as a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who hauing fed him ſelfe with hope of great gaines, doth finde his hopes fruſtrated, and his barke engaiged in a rude Hauen: whereas In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall loue finding in the Vnion made with her obiect contentment paſsing his hopes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing in the ſurplus his complacence; he continewes it in vniting himſelfe, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth further vnite himſelfe in continuing it.</p>

               <head>That there are two portions in the ſoule, and how. <hi>CHAPTER XII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. VVE haue but one Soule THEOTIME, and an indiuiſible one: but in that one Soule, there are diuerſe degrees of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for she is Liuing, Senſible, and Reaſonable, and according to theſe diuerſe degrees, she hath alſo diuerſe Proprieties, and Inclinations by which she is carried to the purſuite and Vnion of things. For firſt we ſee, the Vine doth hate as one would ſaie, and flie the Colewort, ſo that the one of them are pernicious to th'other: and contrariwiſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the Oliue; ſo we perceiue a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie betwixt Men and Serpents, in ſo much that a mans faſting ſpittle is to them mortall: and contrariwiſe, Man and Sheepe haue a wonderous
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2765:51"/> conueniencie, and doth delight the one in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now this inclination doth not proceede from any knowledge the one hath of the birth of his contrarie, or of the profit of him with whom he doth ſympathie: but onely from a certaine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden qualitie, which doth produce this inſenſible contrarietie and antipathie, as alſo this complacence and ſympathie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, we haue in vs the Senſitiue appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, wherby we are moued to the inquirie and flight of diuerſe things by meanes of the ſenſitiue knowledge we haue of them, not vnlike to Cattell wherof one hath an appetite to one thing, an other to an other, according to the knowledge, which they haue agreeable or diſagreeable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and this appetite reſides, or from it floweth the Loue, which we call Senſuall or Brutall, which yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking ought not to be termed loue, but ſimply be called appetite.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, in ſo much as we are reaſonable we haue a will by which we are carried to the inquirie of Good, according as by diſcourſe we know, or iudge it to be ſuch; againe, we manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouer in our Soule as it is Reaſonable two degrees of perfection, which great S. AVGVSTINE, and after him all the DOCTOVRS, haue named the two portions of the ſoule Inferiour and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; of which that is called Inferiour which diſcourſeth, and deduceth conſequences, as she apprehendeth and experienceth by Senſe: and that Superiour, which reaſoneth and drawes conſequences, according to an Intellectuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not founded vpon the experience of ſenſe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2765:52"/> but on the diſcretion and iudgement of the minde of ſpirit; hence this ſuperiour part is called the Spirit or the Mentall part of the ſoule, as the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is termed commonly Senſe, feeling, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now this Superiour part diſcourſeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to two ſorts of lights, that is either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Naturall light, as the Philoſophers, and all thoſe who diſcourſed by ſciences did: or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Supernaturall light as Diuins, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo farre fourth as they eſtablish their diſcourſe vpon Faith, and the reuealed word of God, and more particular illuſtrations, inſpirations, and motions from heauen.

               <p n="1">1. THere were three Portalls in SALOMONS Temple; one for Gentils and ſtrangers, who hauing recourſe to God, came to adore in Hieruſalem: the ſecond for the Iſraelits, men and women, (the ſeparation of men from women not being made by SALOMON); the third for Prieſts, and Leuits; and then there was the Sanctuarie or ſacred houſe the which was open to the Hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2765:54"/> or rather our ſoule as she is reaſonable is the true Temple of the Almightie, who there takes vp his chiefe reſidence. I ſought thee, Saieth S. AVGVSTINE, without my ſelfe, but found thee not, becauſe thou waſt with in me. In this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Temple there are alſo three partitions, which are Three different degrees of reaſon. In the firſt we diſcourſe according to the experience of Senſe: in the ſecond according to Humane Sciences: in the third according to faith; but beyond all this we diſcouer a certaine Hight, or higheſt point of reaſon, and the ſpirituall facultie, which is not guided by the light of diſcourſe or reaſon, but by a ſimple view of the vnderſtanding, and a ſimple touch of the will, by which the ſoule yeelds, and ſubmits her ſelfe to Veritie, and the will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now this extremitie and Climate of our ſoule, this higheſt point of our ſpirit, is naturally well repreſented by the Sanctuarie or Holy place: For firſt in the Sanctuarie there were no win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to giue light; In this degree of the ſoule there is no diſcourſe which doth illuminate. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in the Sanctuarie, all the light entred by the Port; in this degree of the ſoule nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters but by faith, which produceth in manner of rayes, the view and guſt of the beautie and bountie of the good pleaſure of God. Thirdly, none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Sanctuarie, ſaue the high Prieſt; In this point of the ſoule, diſcourſe approacheth not, but onely the high, vniuerſall, and ſoueraigne fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that the diuine will ought ſoueraignely to be embraced, loued, and approued, not onely in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2765:54"/> ſome particular things, but generally in all things: nor generally in all things onely, but alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in each thing. Fouerthly, the High Prieſt entring into the Sanctuarie, obſcured euen that light which came by the Port, and the abundance of perfumes from his Thurible repulſed the rayes of light, which by the Port ſought paſſage; and all the light which is in the ſupreame part of the ſoule, is in ſome ſort obſcured, and vealed, by the renunciations, and reſignations which the ſoule makes, not deſiring ſo much to behould and ſee the Beautie of the Truth, and the Truth of the Bountie preſented vnto her, as to embrace and adore the ſame: in ſuchwiſe, that the ſoule would almoſt shut her eyes, as ſoone as she begins to ſee the dignitie of Gods will, to th'end, that not being further occupied in that conſideration, she might more powerfully and perfectly receiue it, and by an abſolute compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence infinitly vnite, and ſubmit her ſelfe thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Fiftly to conclude, in the Sanctuarie was kept the Arke of the Alliance, and in that, or ioyning to it, the Tables of the Lawe, MANNA in a golden veſſell, AARONS rod, which in a night bore flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and fruite; and in this higheſt point of the ſoule, firſt of all the light of faith, figured by the MANNA encloſed in the pot whereby we quietly beleeue the truth of myſteries which our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can not attaine to; ſecondly, the profit of hope repreſented by Aarons florishing and fruitfull rod, by which we confidently expect our promiſed happineſſe, which we ſee not. Thirdly, the ſweetneſſe of holy charitie repreſented by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2765:55"/> Gods commandements which she containes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we repoſe in the vnion of our ſpirit with God's, which we ſcarcely perceiue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And although Faith, Hope, and Charitie doe diſperce their diuine motions, into almoſt all the faculties of the ſoule, as well reaſonable as ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, reducing and holily ſubiecting them to their iuſt authoritie: yet their ſpeciall reſidence, their true and naturall Mannor, is this ſupreame region of the ſoule, from whence as from a happie ſource of liue water, it brancheth it ſelfe out by diuerſe Conduits, and Brookes vpon the inferiour partes, and faculties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So that THEOTIME in the ſuperiour part of reaſon, there are Two degrees of reaſon; in the one, thoſe diſcourſes are made which depend of faith, and ſupernaturall light; in the other the ſimple repoſe of faith, hope, and charitie. SAINT PAVLES ſoule, found here ſelfe preſſed with two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe deſires: the one, to be deliuered from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to flie vp ſtreight to IESVS CHRIST, the other to remaine in this would to labour in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſoules; both theſe deſires were without doubt in the Superiour part, for they proceeded both from Charitie: but his reſolution of the later proceeded not from diſcourſe, but from a ſimple light, and liking he had of his maiſters will, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which the very point of the ſpirit of this great ſeruant turned, to the preiudice of all that Diſcourſe might conclude.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if Faith, Hope, and Charitie, be formed by this holy Reſt in the point of the ſpirit, how comes it to paſſe that in the Inferiour part, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2765:55"/> is made depending of the light of Faith. As we ſee Aduocats in many words pleade the facts, and rights of parties at the Barre; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Senate from aboue reſolues all the ſtrife by a poſitiue ſentence, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the Aduocats and Auditours reſt not for all that to diſcourſe amongſt them ſelues of the Parliaments motiues ther vnto. Euen ſo THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIME after diſcourſe, and aboue all that the grace of God haue perſuaded the point and higheſt part of the ſpirit to beleeue, and forme an Act of faith by manner of ſentence, the vnderſtanding doth not leaue to diſcourſe againe vpon that ſame Act of faith already conceiued, to conſider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and reaſons therof, yet ſo, as Theologicall Diſcourſes paſſe in the lower Benches, and Barre of the Superiour portion of the ſoule: but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, aboue in the Tribunall of the point of the ſpirit. And becauſe the knowledge of theſe 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the reaſon, is much conducing to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all the treatiſes of ſpirituall things, I haue enlarged my ſelfe in the explication therof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LOue is deuided into two ſpecies wherof the one is called Loue of beneuolence or good will, th'other, Loue of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence. Loue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is that, by which we loue things with pretention of profit. Loue of beneuolence that, by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2765:56"/> which we loue a thing for it's owne profit. For what other thing is it, to loue one with the loue of beneuolence or good will, then to will him good?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he to whom we will good, haue already obtained and poſſeſt it, then we wish it him by the pleaſure, and contentment which we haue to ſee him poſſeſſed of it; and hence ſprings Loue of complacence, which is onely an act of the will by which it is ioyned and vnited to the pleaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and good of an other. But in caſe he to whom we wish good, haue not yet obtained it, we deſire it him, and thence, that loue is termed Loue of deſire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Loue of beneuolence is exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of the beloued, it is called Loue of ſimple beneuolence, but when it is practiſed with mutuall correſpondance it is called loue of friendship. Now Mutuall correſpondence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of three things, to wit a mutuall loue, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall knowledge of the ſame, conuerſation and priuate familiaritie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we loue our friend without preferring him before others, t'is Simple familiaritie; if with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, then this familiaritie turnes to be Dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or as one would ſaie, A loue by election, as making choice of this, from amongſt many things we loue, and preferring it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Againe when by this Dilection we doe not much preferre one friend before others, t'is called Simple dilection; but if contrariwiſe we much more eſteeme, and greatly preferre one before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the ſame ranck, then this friendship is called Dilection by excellencie.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:2765:56"/>6. But if the eſteeme, and preference of our friend, though great and without equall, doe yet enter into compariſon, and proportion with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the friendship shall be called Eminent dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but if the eminencie therof doe without proportion incomparably paſſe all others, then it is graced with the Title of Incomparable, ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and ſupereminent dilection; and in a word it shall be Charite due to one God onely: And indeede in our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage the word deare, deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, indeared, doth teſtifie a certaine particular eſteeme, priſe, or valewe: ſo, that as amongſt the people the word HOMO is almoſt appropriated to the male-kind as to the more excellent ſexe: and the word ADORATION is in a manner due to God onely as it's prime obiect: ſo the word CHARITIE is appropriated to him, as to the ſupreame and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne dilection.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. ORIGIN ſaieth that the holy Scripture, in his opinion, vſed the word Charitie and Dilection as termes more honeſt; leaſt the word Loue might giue occaſion of euill thoughts to the weaker ſort, as being more proper to ſignifie a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paſſion then a ſpirituall affection. But S. AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE hauing deeplier weighed the vſe of Gods word, clearely shewes, that the word Loue is no leſſe ſacred then the word Dilection,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2765:57"/> and that as well the one, as the other doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignifie an holy affection, as ſometimes alſo a depraued paſſion, alleading to this purpoſe diuerſe paſſages of holy Scripture. But the great S. DENIS, as chiefe Doctour of the PROPRIETIE OF DIVINE NAMES, goes much further in fauour of the word Loue, teaching that the Diuins, that is the Apoſtels and their firſt Diſciples (for this Saint knew no other Diuins) to diſabuſe the vulgare, and tame their Phanſie who took the word Loue, in a profaine and carnall ſenſe, the more willingly imployed it to ſignifie diuine things, then that of Dilection, and though they thought that both were indifferently taken for the ſame thing: yet ſome of them were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the word Loue was more proper and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to God, then the word Dilection. Hence the diuine IGNATIVS left theſe words written, MY LOVE IS CRVCIFIED. And as theſe Auncient Diuins made vſe of the word Loue in heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to quit it of the touch of impuritie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the worlds imagination it was ſuſpected, ſo to expreſſe humane affections, they pleaſed to vſe the word Dilection, as exempt from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dishoneſtie. Whervpon ſome of them, as S. DENIS reporteth, ſaied, thy Dilection hath made entrie into my ſoule as the Dilection of women, In fine the word Loue doth ſignifie more feruour, efficacie, and actiuitie, then that of Dilection; ſo that amongſt the Latins, Dilection is much leſſe ſignificatiue then Loue. CLAVDIVS ſaieth, the great Oratour bears me Dilection, and to ſaie it more excellently, He loues me: and therefore the word
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2765:57"/> Loue, as the more excellent, hath iuſtly bene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon Charitie as principall, and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of all Loues. For theſe reaſons, and for that I pretended to ſpeake of the Acts of Charitie more then of her habits, I haue intitled this ſmall worke, A TREATISE OF THE LOVE OF GOD.</p>

               <head>Of the conueniencie betwixt God and man. <hi>CHAPTER. XV.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AS ſoone as a man takes the Diuinitie into his conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a little atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, he feeles a certaine delightfull leaping of the heart, witneſſing that God, is God of man's heart, and that our vnderſtanding is neuer ſo filled with pleaſure, as in this conſideration, the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wherof, as ſaieth the prince of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is more worth then the greateſt of other things, as the leaſt Sunne beame is brighter, then the greateſt from the Moone, or ſtarres; yea is more lightſome then the Moone, and ſtarres alltogether, ſo that if any dreadfull accident aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie our heart, it hath preſently recourſe to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, proteſting therin, that when all other things faile him, that onely ſtands his friend, and when danger threateneth, that onely is his ſoueraigne good, and can ſaue and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This confidence, this pleaſure which man's heart naturally takes in God, can ſpring from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2765:58"/> no other roote then from the conueniencie which is betwixt God and man's ſoule, a great, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete conueniencie; a conueniencie which each one knowes, but few vnderſtands; a conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which cannot be denied, nor yet be well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; we are created to the ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: what is this to ſaie? if not, that we haue an extreamely great proportion with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our ſoule is ſpirituall, indiuiſible, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, vnderſtands, willeth, and that freely, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſcourſe, iudgment, knowledge, and of vertues, in all which it reſembles God. It is all in all, and all in euery part of the bodie, as the Diuinitie is all in this our All, and all in euery part therof: man knowes and loues himſelfe by acts produced, and expreſſed by his vnderſtanding, and will, diſtinguished in them ſelues; remaining notwithſtanding inſeparably vnited in the ſoule, and in theſe faculties from whence they proceede. So the Sonne proceedes from the Father, as his knowledge expreſſed; and the Holy Ghoſt, as loue expired, and produced from the Father and the Sonne: both the Perſons being diſtinct in them ſelues, and from the Father, and yet inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and vnited, or rather one ſame ſole, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, onely, indiuiſible Diuinitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But beſides this conueniencie of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, there is an incomparable correſpondence betwixt God and man, by reaſon of their recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perfection, not that God can receiue any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from man, but becauſe, as man cannot be perfected but by the diuine Bountie, ſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2765:58"/> Bountie can ſcarcely ſo well exerciſe it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection out of it ſelfe, as vpon our humanitie, th'one hath great want, and capicitie to receiue good; th'other great abundance, and inclination to beſtow it: nothing is ſo agreeable to pouertie as a liberall abundance, nor to a liberall abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as a needie pouertie, and by how much the good is more abundant, by ſo much more ſtrong is the inclination to poure fourth, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelfe: By how much more the poore man is in want, by ſo much greater is his appetite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, as an emptie thing to fill it ſelfe. The concurrence then of abundance and pouertie, is moſt ſweete and agreeable: nor could one almoſt haue diſcerned, whether the abounding good hath a greater contentment in opening, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it ſelfe; or the needie and indigent good in receiuing and drawing to it ſelfe; if our Sauiour had not ſaied, that there is a greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in giuing then in receiuing: but where there is more felicitie, there is more ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diuine bountie receiues greater pleaſure in giuing, then we in receiuing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mothers haue ſometimes their breaſts ſo fruitfull and abundant, that they cannot containe, but giue them ſome child to ſucke, and though the child draw the pappe with great ardour, yet doth the Mother giue it more ardently, the ſucking child preſſed by it's neceſsitie, and the nourishing Mother preſſed with her fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſacred Spouſe wished for the holy kiſſe of vnion: ô ſaieth she, let him deigne me
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2765:59"/> a kiſſe of his mouth. But is there Sympathie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ô thou Beloued of the Beloued betwixt thee and thy heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Spouſe, to come to the vnion which thou deſireſt? I quoth she, giue me this kiſſe of vnion ô thou deare friend of my heart, for thy dugges are better then wine, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with excellent odours. New wine works and boyles in it ſelfe by vertue of it's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cannot be contained within the peece, and thy dugges are yet better, they preſſe thy breaſt with continuall shuttings pouring out their ſuperabundant milke, as wishing to be diſcharged of it: and to draw the children of thy heart to ſucke them, they poure out a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully drawing odour then all the odours of perfums, ſo that THEOTIME we ſtand in neede of Gods abundance being poore and needie, but Gods abundance hath no neede of our pouertie but by reaſon of the excellencie of his perfection, and bountie. Bountie, which is not at all bettered by communication: For it doth acquire nothing in pouring it ſelfe out of it ſelfe, but contrariwiſe giues: but our pouertie would remaine abiect and miſerable, if it were not enriched by the diuine abundance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our ſoule then ſeeing that nothing can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly content her, and that nothing the world can afforde, is able to fill her capacitie, conſidering that her vnderſtanding hath an infinite inclination ſtill to know more; and her will an vnwearied ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to ſearch and loue good: hath she not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to crie out. Ah, I am not then made for this world! There is a ſoueraigne good on which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2765:59"/> an infinite workman who hath impreſſed in me this endleſſe deſire of knowing, and this inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable appetite: and therfore I muſt tend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my ſelfe towards him, to vnite and ioyne my ſelfe to his bountie, to whom I appertaine and am; Such is the ſympathie betwixt God and mans ſoule!</p>

The ſweetneſſe of his ſoueraigne prouidence required, that he should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribute to the happie men of whom we ſpeake,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2765:60"/> as much helpe as should be neceſſarie to practiſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d effect that inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; And of one ſide this helpe should be naturall, as being agreeable to nature, and tending to the loue of God, as he is authour and ſoueraigne Maiſter of nature; and on th'other ſide it should be ſupernaturall; becauſe it would correſpond not with mans pure nature, but with nature adorned, enriched and honoured by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iuſtice, which is a ſupernaturall qualitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Gods ſpeciall fauour. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching loue aboue all things, which should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed according to this helpe, it should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led naturall, becauſe vertuous actions take their names from their obiects and motiues, and this loue wherof we ſpeake should tend onely to God, as acknowledged to be Authour, Lord ad ſoueraigne of euery creature by a naturall light onely, and conſequently to be amiable and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable aboue all things, by naturall propenſion and inclination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And although now our humane nature be not endewed with that health and originall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which the firſt man had in his Creation, and that contrariwiſe we are greatly depraued by ſinne, yet notwithſtanding the holy inclination of of louing God aboue all things ſtaies with vs, as alſo the naturall light by which we ſee his ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne goodneſſe more amiable then all other things, and it is impoſsible that one thinking at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely vpon God, yea euen by naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe onely, should not feele a certaine touch of loue, which the ſecret inclination of our nature doth excite in the bottome of our hearts, by

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2765:61"/> left behind them. SOCRATES the moſt laudable amongſt them, came to the cleare knowledge of the vnitie of God, and felt in himſelfe ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to loue him, that as S. AVGVSTINE wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, many were of opinion that he neuer had other ayme in teaching morall Philoſophie, then to purifie their witts for the better contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soueraigne good, which is the moſt indiuiſible Diuinitie. And for PLATO he doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declare himſelfe in his definition of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, and of a Philoſopher, ſaying that to doe the part of a Philoſopher is nothing elſe but to loue God, and a Philoſopher no other thing then, A Louer of God. What shall I ſaie of great ARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOTLE, who ſo efficaciouſly proues God's vnitie, and ſpoake ſo honorably of it, in diuerſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ô eternall God! thoſe great witts which had ſo great knowledge of the Diuinitie, and ſo great a propenſion to loue it, wanted all of them force and courage to loue it well indeede. By viſible things they came to the inuiſible things of God, yea euen to his eternall vertue, and Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſaieth the Apoſtle; in ſo much, as they are inexcuſable as hauing knowne God, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing glorified him as God, nor rendred him thankes. Indeede they glorified him in ſome ſort attributing vnto him the ſoueraigne Titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet did they not glorifie him as they ought; that is, they glorified him not aboue all things, not hauing the heart to ruinate Idolatrie, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Is it not great pitie THEOTIME to ſee SOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES, as PLATO reports, ſpeake vpon his death-bed, concerning the Gods, as though there had bene many, he knowing ſo well that there was but one onely? Is't not a thing to be deplored, that PLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO who vnderſtoode ſo clearely the truth of the Diuine vnitie, should ordaine that ſacrifice should be done to many Gods? And is it not a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing that TRISMEGISTVS should ſo baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament, and plaine the abolishment of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, who in ſo many occaſions, had ſpoaken ſo worthily of the Diuinitie? But aboue all I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the poore good man EPICTETES, whoſe words and ſentences are ſo ſweete in our tongue, tranſlated by the learned, and faire Plume of the R. F. D.

For what a pitie was it I pray you to ſee this excellent Philoſopher, ſpeake of God ſome times with ſuch guſt, feeling, and Zeale, that one would haue taken him for a Chriſtian, comming from ſome holy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found meditation, and yet againe at diuerſe times, mentioning the Pagan Gods?

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2765:63"/> naturally an inclination to it? Is not Nature vaine to incite vs to a Loue, which she cannot beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs? Why doth she moue in vs a thirſt of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious water, wherof she cannot make vs drinke? Ah THEOTIME how good God was with vs! the perfidiouſneſſe which we did commit in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, deſerued truely that he should haue depriued vs of all the markes of his beneuolence, and of the fauour which he deigned to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when he imprinted vpon her the light of his diuine countenance, and indued our hearts with a ioyfulneſſe to perceiue themſelues inclined to the loue of the diuine goodneſſe, to the end that the Angels ſeeing this miſerable man, might by way of compaſſion haue occaſion to ſaie; is this the creature perfect in beautie? the glorie of the earth?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this infinite Clemencie could neuer be ſo rigorous to the worke of his hands. He ſaw that we were clothed with flesh; A winde which conſumes in paſsing and returns not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the bowells of his Mercy, he would not vtterly ruinate vs, nor depriue vs of the ſigne of his loſt grace, to the end that weighing, and feeling in our ſelues this inclination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to loue, we should endeauour to loue indeede, and to the end that none might iuſtly ſaie, Who will shew vs the God? For though by this ſole naturall inclination we cannot be ſo happie, as to loue God as we ought; yet if we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie it faithfully, the ſweetneſſe of the diuine Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, would afford vs ſome aſſiſtance, by meanes wherof, we might make progreſſe, and ſeconding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2765:63"/> this firſt aſsiſtance. God would beſtow vpon vs another greater, and conduct vs from good to better in all ſweetneſſe, till he brought vs to the Soueraigne loue, to which our naturall inclination drawes vs; ſythence it is certaine, that the diuine goodneſſe doth neuer denie his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, more and more to aduance him whom he ſees faithfull in a little, and doe what he is able.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This naturall inclination then which we haue to loue God aboue all things, is not left for nothing in our hearts: for God of his part makes vſe of it as of a Handle, by which he takes hold, to drawe vs more ſweetely vnto himſelfe; and it ſeemes the Diuine Goodneſſe by this impreſsion, doth in ſome ſort, hold our hearts tyed, as little birdes in a ſtring, by which he can drawe vs when it pleaſeth his mercy to take pitie vpon vs: to vs it is a marke and memoriall of our firſt Principle, and Creator, to whoſe loue it moues vs, leauing in vs a ſecret intimation, that we belong to his Diuine Goodneſſe. Euen as Harts whom princes haue ſometimes taken, and put vpon them Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers with their Armes, though afterwards they cauſe them ſo to be let looſe, and runne at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Foreſt, doe not leaue to be knowen to any that lights vpon them, not onely to haue bene once taken by the Prince, whoſe Cognoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance they beare but alſo to be ſtill reſerued for him: for ſo the extreeme old age of a Hart was knowen, which according to ſome Hiſtorians was taken three hundred yeares after the death of Ceſar, becauſe he was found in a Coller

<q>CESAR LET ME GOE.</q>

               <p n="4">4. Certes the honorable inclination which God hath left in our hearts doth teſtifie as well to our friends as our enemies, that we did not onely ſometimes belong to our Creator, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, though he did let vs runne, and leaue vs to the mercy of our freewill, that we doe ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto him, and he reſerued a right in vs, to take vs againe to himſelfe when he pleaſed, to ſaue vs according as his holy and ſweete prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shall require. Hence the Royall Prophet termes this inclination, not a light onely, in that it makes vs ſee whether we are to tend, but alſo, a Ioye and a cheerefulneſſe, for that it doth comfort vs in our ſtraying, giuing vs a hope that he who did ingraue and left in vs this faire marke of our origine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends alſo and deſires to reduce and bring vs back thither, if we be ſo happie as to leaue our ſelues to the will of the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

But he is in himſelfe one, moſt ſole, moſt ſimple and moſt indiuiſibly one Perfection: for all that is in him, is no other thing then himſelfe: And all the Excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies which we ſaie are in him in ſo great diuerſitie, are there vnited in a moſt ſimple, and pure Vnitie.

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:2765:65"/> to all that is perfect. Now to aſſigne a perfect name to this Supreame excellencie, which in it's moſt ſingular vnitie doth comprehend, yea ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all excellencie, is not within the reach of a Creature Humane or Angelicall. For as we finde in the Apocalypſe our Lord hath a Name which no man knowes but himſelfe; for that he onely perfectly ſeeing his owne infinite Perfection, he alſo can onely expreſſe it in a Name proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: whence the Auncients affirmed, that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was true Diuine; for ſo much as none but he onely could arriue to the full knowledge of the infinite greatneſſe of the diuine Perfection, nor conſequently ſet it out in words. For this cauſe, God by the Angell anſwering Samſons Father who demanded his Name. Why doſt thou demand my Name quoth he, which is Admirable? As though he would haue ſaied; my Name may be admired, but neuer pronounced by Creaturs: It muſt be adored, but cannot be compriſed, ſaue by me, who onely can pronounce the proper Name, by which truely and to the life I expreſſe my Excellencie. Our thoughts are too feeble to forme a conceite which might repreſent an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie ſo Immenſe, that comprehendeth in his moſt ſimple, and moſt indiuiſible Perfection, diſtinctly and perfectly all other Perfections, in an infinitly excellent and eminent manner, to which our thoughts cannot raiſe themſelues; At leaſt in ſome ſort to ſpeake of God, we are forced to vſe a great number of names ſaying that he is GOOD, WISE, OMNIPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENT, TRVE, IVST, HOLY, INFINITE,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2765:66"/> IMMORTALL, INVISIBLE. And certes we ſaie true, God is all this together, becauſe he is more then all this; that is to ſaie he is in ſo pure, excellent, and eleuated a manner, that in one moſt ſimple perfection he containes the Vertue, Vigour, and excellencie of all perfection.</p>

But on the other ſide let's behould a Stamper of picturs, who hauing ſpred his leafe vpon the grauen Planch of the Natiuitie giuing but one onely ſtroke of his Preſſe, and in that onely touch THEOTIME he will perfect his worke, and preſently he will take off his picture, gratfully repreſenting in a faire and ſmouth cut all that ought to be imagined according to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtorie: and though in one motion he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the worke; yet it carrieth a great number of perſonages and other different things, each one well diſtinguished in his order, rancke, place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and proportion. And one not acquainted with the ſecret, would be aſtonished to ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from one Act, ſo great varietie of effects. So THEOTIME Nature as a Painter, multiplies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſifies her Acts, according as the workes she hath in hand are diuerſe; and she takes great time to finish great effects; But God as the Stamper, gaue being to all the diuerſitie of Creaturs which haue bene, are, or shall be by one onely touch of his omnipotent will, drawing from his Idea, as from a well grauen ſtampe, this admirable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of perſons, and other things which ſucceede in ſeaſons, ages, and times in their due order and being, this Soueraigne vnitie of the diuine Act being oppoſed to Confuſion and Diſorder, not to Diſtinction and Varietie, which it implies in the compoſition of beautie, reducing all Differences and Diuerſities to Proportion; Proportion to Order, and Order to the Vnitie of the world
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2765:68"/> which compriſeth all things created viſible and inuiſible, all which together are called the Vniuerſe peraduenture becauſe their Diuerſitie is reduced to Vnitie; as though one would ſaie One-diuerſe that is One and Diuerſe, Vnitie with Diuerſitie, or Diuerſitie with Vnitie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In ſomme, the ſoueraigne diuine Vnitie doth diuerſifie; and his permanent Eternitie giues change to all things, becauſe the perfection of this vnitie being aboue all difference and varietie it is able to furnish all the diuerſities of created perfections with their being; and contains a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to produce them; In ſigne of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture relats, that God in the beginning ſaied, let the lights be made in the firmament of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and let them ſeparate daie from night, and let them be ſignes for times, daies, and yeares; further we ſee euen to this daie a perpetuall reuolution of times and ſeaſons, which shall continew till the end of the world, to teach vs, that as
<q>
                     <l>One word of his commanding will</l>
                     <l>Doth all the world with motion fill.</l>
                  </q> So the onely eternall will of his diuine Maieſtie, extends his force from age to age, yea to the ages of ages, to all that hath bene, is, or shall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, nothing at all hauing any beeing, but by this ſole, moſt ſimple, and moſt eternall diuine Act, to which be honour and glorie.

               <p n="1">1. GOd then THEOTIME needes no diuerſitie of Acts ſyth that one onely diuine Act of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2765:69"/> his All puiſſant will by reaſon of it's infinite perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is ſufficient to produce all the varietie of workes. But we mortalls muſt treate of them, in ſuch an intelligible methode and manner, as our ſmall capacities may attaine vnto. Following which, in treating of the Diuine prouidence, let vs conſider I praie you the raigne of the great SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMON, as a perfect modell of the art of good gouernment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This great king then, knowing by diuine inſpiration that the Weale-publicke dependeth vpon Religion, as the Bodie vpon the Soule: and Religion vpon the Weale-publicke, as the Soule vpon the Bodie, he diſpoſed in his minde of all the parts requiſite, as well for the eſtablishment of Religion, as that of the Common-wealth; and touching Religion, he determined that a Temple was to be erected of ſuch and ſuch a length, breadth, and hight; ſo many Porches, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, ſo many windowes and ſo fourth concerning the reſt which belonged to the Temple: Then ſo many Sacryficers, ſo many Singers, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Temple. And as for the Common wealth, he ordained to make a Royall Palace, and a Court for his Maieſtie; in it, ſo many Stewards, ſo many Gentlemen and other Courtiers. And for the people, Iudges and other Magiſtrats who were to execute Iuſtice: further for the aſſurance of his kingdome and eſtablishment of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks repoſe, wherof himſelfe was partaker, he appointed in time of peace a powrefull Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for warre, and to this effect two hundred and fiftie Commanders in diuerſe charges, fortie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2765:69"/> thouſand horſe, and all that great furniture which the Scripture, and Hiſtorians doe teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now hauing thus made his count, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in himſelfe of all the principall things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for his Kingdome, he came to the Act of Prouidence, and paſſed in his cogitation all things neceſſarie for the ſtructure of the Temple; to maintaine the ſacred Officers, Miniſters, Royall Magiſtrats, and men of armes, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, he reſolued to ſend to HIERAM for fit tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to begin commerce with PERV, and OPHIR, and to take all conuenient meanes to procure all things requiſite for the entertainement and good conduct of his enterpriſe. Neither ſtaied he there THEOTIME, for hauing made his proiect, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated in himſelfe about the proper meanes to accomplish it; comming to the practiſe, he created officers according to his determination, and by a good gouernment cauſed prouiſion to be made of all things requiſite to comply with, and execute their charges; ſo that hauing the knowledge of the art of well gouerning, he executed that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which he had paſſed in his mind touching the creation of Officers of euery ſort, and effected his Prouidence by the good gouernment which he vſed; and ſo his art of good gouernment which conſiſted in diſpoſition, prouidence, or foreſight, was practiſed in the creation of Officers, Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and good carriage of things; But for ſo much as that diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was fruteleſſe without the Creation of Officers, and Creation alſo vaine without Prouidence which lookes for neceſſaries for the conſeruation of Officers created or ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and in fine, that this Conſeruation effected
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2765:70"/> by good gouernment, is no other thing then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence put in execution: and therfore not onely the Diſpoſition, but alſo the Creation, and good gouernment of SALOMON, were called by the name PROVIDENCE: nor doe we indeede ſaie that a man is prouident vnleſſe he gouerne well.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now THEOTIME ſpeaking of heauenly things, according to the impreſsion made in vs by the conſideration of humane things, we affirme that God, hauing had an eternall, and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of the Art of making the world for his glorie; Firſt in his diuine Vnderſtanding, he diſpoſed all the principall parts of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, which might render him honour: to wit Angelicall and Humane Nature; and in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Nature, the varietie of Hierarchies and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders taught vs by the ſacred Scripture, and holy Doctours: as alſo amongſt Men he ordained that there should be ſo great diuerſitie as we ſee. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this ſame Eternitie, he made accompt in himſelfe, and foreſaw all the meanes requiſite for Men, and Angels to come to the end for which he had ordained them, and ſo made the Act of his prouidence, and without ſtaying there to effect his Diſpoſition, he Actually created Angels, and men: and to effect his Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he did and doth furnish reaſonable Creatures with all things neceſſarie to attaine Glorie: So that to ſpeake in a word, the Soueraigne prouidence is no other thing, then the Act wherby God doth furnish me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Angels, with the meanes neceſſarie or profitable to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their end. But becauſe our meanes are of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2765:70"/> diuerſe kindes, we doe alſo diuerſifie the name of Prouidence, and ſaie that there is one Prouidence naturall, another Supernaturall, and that this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is either Generall, ſpeciall, or particular.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And becauſe hereafter THEOTIME I shall exhort you to ioyne your will to God's Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; while I am in hand with this diſcourſe, I'le tell you a word of Naturall prouidence. God then willing to prouide men of naturall meanes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for them to render glorie to the diuine boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he produced in their behalfe all the beaſts, and plants: and to prouid for them alſo, he produced varietie of Territories, Seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Fountains, Windes, Raine, and as well for man, as th'other things appertaining vnto him, he created the elements, heauen, and ſtarres, ordaining in an admirable manner, that almoſt each Creature affords a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall ſeruice one to another; Horſes carrie vs, and we dreſſe and keepe them; Sheepe doe feede and cloth vs, and we graze them; the Earth ſends her vapours to the aire, it renders the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in showres; the Hand ſerues the Foote, and the Foote the Hand. O! He that should conſider the commerce and generall trafficke with a great correſpondance, exerciſed amongſt Creaturs, how many amorous paſſions would moue his heart toward this ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne wiſdome, to crie out; thy Prouidence, ô great eternall father, gouernes all things! S. BASILE and S. AMBROSE in their EXAMEROVS, the good LEWIS OF GRANADO in his Introduction to the Creede, and LEWIS RICHEOME in diuerſe of his faire workes, would ſuggeſt many motiues to well borne ſoules, to profit in this ſubiect.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:2765:71"/>6. Thus Deare THEOTIME this Prouidence toucheth all, raignes ouer all, and reduceth all to his glorie. There is notwithſtanding Chance, and Vnexpected accidents, but that in regard of vs onely; for doubtleſſe they were moſt certaine to the Diuine prouidence, who foreſeeth and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth them to the good of the worlds Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Now theſe accident s doe happen by the concourſe of diuerſe cauſes, which hauing no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall alliance one with the other, doe produce each of them their particular effect, yet ſo as from their concourſe, there iſſueth another effect, of a diuerſe nature, to which though it could not be foreſeene, all the different cauſes did contribute. For example ESCHILVS his curioſitie was iuſtly chaſtiſed, who being foretolde by a Diuine, that he should perish by the fall of a houſe, kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all that daie in a plaine field to eſcape the deſtinie, and ſtaying cloſe to it bareheadded, a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con who dareing in the aire held in her beeke a TORTOISE (eſpying his bald head, and geſſing it had bene the point of a Rocke) let the shell fall right vpon him; and behould ESCHILVS dying in the brode field, ſuppreſſed with the houſe, broken with the shell. This was doubleſſe an Vnexpected chance: For he betooke not himſelfe to the field to die, but to eſchape death; nor did the Fanlcon dreame of cracking a Poets crowne, but the crowne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shell of the Tortoiſe, to make him ſelfe maiſter of the meate within; yet it chanced to the contrarie, for the Tortoiſe remained ſafe, and the poore ESCHILVS was ſlaine. According to vs, this chance was vnexpected, but in reſpect of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2765:71"/> prouidence which looked fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue and ſaw the concourſe of cauſes, it was an Act of iuſtice punishing the ſuperſtition of the man. Old IOSEP'S aduenturs were admirable for varietie, and for their paſſages betwixt two extreemes. His Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who to extinguish him had ſold him, were amazed to ſee him become Vice-Roy, and were mighty apprehenſiue that he remained ſenſible of the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they had done him: but no, ſaied he, it was not ſo much by your plot, that I was ſent hither as by the Diuine prouidence, you had wicked deſignes againſt me, but God turned all to good. Doe you marke THEOTIME the world would haue termed this Fortune or Doubtfull euent, which IOSEPH calleth a proiect of the Soueraigne Prouidence, which turneth and reduceth all to his ſeruice. The like it is of all things which happen in the world, yea euen of Monſters, the birth of which makes compleate and perfect workes more eſteemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets admiration, prouokes diſcourſe whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wholeſome thoughts proceede; In fine they are to the world, as shadowes to picturs, which giue a grace, and ſeeme euen to rayſe the colours.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. All God's workes are ordained to man and Angels ſaluation: but ſee the order of his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this behalfe, in ſuch wiſe as by the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2765:72"/> obſeruation of holy Scripturs and the writings of the Auncients we are able to diſcouer it, and as our weakneſſe permits vs to ſpeake of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God knew from all Eternitie that he was able to make an innumerable number of creaturs in diuerſe perfections and qualities, to whom he might communicate himſelfe; and conſidering that amongſt all the ſorts of communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there was none ſo excellent, as to ioyne himſelfe to ſome created nature in ſuch ſort as the Creature might be ingraffed and implanted in the Diuinitie, and become one onely perſon with it; His infinite Bountie which of it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards a communication, reſolued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to communicate himſelfe in this manner, to th'end that as eternally there is an Eſſentiall communication in God, by which the Father doth communicate all his infinite and indiuiſible Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to the Sonne in producing him, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne together producing the holy Ghoſt doe communicate to him alſo their owne indiuiſible Deitie. So in like manner this Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſweetneſſe was ſo perfectly communicated without himſelfe to a Creature, that the Created and Diuine Nature, retaining each of them their owne proprietie were notwithſtanding ſo vnited together, that they were but one Perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now of all the Creaturs which that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne omnipotencie could produce, he thought good to make choice of the ſame Humanitie, which afterwards in effect, was ioyned to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God the Sonne, to which he determined that incomparable honour of the Perſonall vnion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2765:72"/> to his diuine Maieſtie, to th'end that for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it might enioy by way of Excellencie the treaſurs of his infinite glorie, and hauing thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for this happineſſe, the ſacred Humanitie of our Sauiour: the Supreame prouidence decreed not to reſtraine his goodneſſe to the onely Perſon of his well beloued So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, but fauorably to poure it out vpon diuerſe other Creaturs, and in groſſe vpon the innumerable number of things which he could produce, he made choyce to create Men and Angels to accompagnie his Sonne, participate of his graces and glorie, adore and prayſe him for euer. And for as much as he ſaw, that he could in diuerſe manners effect the Humanitie of his Sonne, making him true Man; as for example, creating him of nothing, not onely in regard of the ſoule, but euen in regard of the bodie alſo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by forming the bodie of ſome precedent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he did that of ADAM and EVE; or by way of Ordinarie generation by man and woman, &amp; finally by Extraordinarie generation of a woman without man; he determined that the worke should be effected by the laſt way; and of all the women he might haue choiſen to this end, he made choice of the moſt holy virgin our Lady, by meanes wherof, the Sauiour of our ſoules should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Man, but euen a Child of mankind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Furthermore the Sacred prouidence deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to produce all the other things, as well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall as ſupernaturall, in behalfe of our Sauiour, to th'end that men and Angels, in ſeruing him, might participate his glorie, in ſequall wherof though God would create as well men, as Angels
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2765:73"/> endewed with Freewill, and poſſeſſed of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to elect good or euill; yet neuertheleſſe to teſtifie that of his part they were dedicated to glorie, he created them all in Originall Iuſtice which is no other thing then A moſt ſweete loue diſpoſing, conuerting, and weighing them to eternall felicitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But becauſe this Supreame Wiſdome had deliberated to temper this Originall Loue in ſuch ſort with the will of his Creaturs, that Loue should not force the will, but should leaue her in her freedome; he foreſaw that a part, yet the leſſe, of the Angelicall nature voluntarily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the diuine loue, should conſequently looſe their Glorie. And for that, the Angelicall nature could not offend herein, but by an expreſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice without temptation, or motiue whatſoeuer which might pleade their excuſe; and that on the other ſide, the farre greater part of that ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remained conſtant in the ſeruice of theire Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; God who had ſo amply glorified his Mercy in the worke of the Creation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, would alſo magnifie his Iuſtice, and for his indignations ſake, reſolued for euer to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that woefull and accurſed troope of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, who in the furie of their Rebellion had ſo villanouſly abandoned him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He alſo foreſaw well, that the firſt man would abuſe his libertie, and forſaking Grace would looſe Glorie, yet would he not treate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ſo rigorouſly, as he deliberated to treate the angelicall. T'was humane nature wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had determined to take a bleſſed peace to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2765:73"/> it to his Deitie. He ſaw that it was a feeble nature, a winde which paſſeth and returns not, that is, which is diſſipated in paſſing. He conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſurpriſe which Satan made againſt the firſt man, and weighed the gteatneſſe of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which animated him. He ſaw that all the race of men perished, by the fault of one onely, ſo that moued by theſe reaſons, he beheld our nature with the eye of Pitie, and reſolued to take it to his Mercy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to th'end that the ſweetneſſe of his Mercy might be adorned with the beautie of his Iuſtice he deliberated to ſaue man by way of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Redemption, which being it could not well be effected, but by his Sonne, he concluded that he should redeeme man, not onely by the price of one of his amourous actions, though more then moſt ſufficient, to ranſome a thouſand millions of worlds: but euen by all the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable amourous actions, and dolourous paſsions which he should doe, or ſuffer till death, and death of the croſſe, to which he determined him; that ſo he might be made a companion of our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to make vs afterwards companions of his Glorie, showing therby the riches of his Bountie in this copious, abundant, ſuperabundant, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, and exceſſiue Redemption which regained and reſtored vs all neceſſaries to attaine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo that no man can euer plaine, as though the Diuine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were deficient to any</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw THEOTIME, affirming that God had ſeene, and willed firſt one thing, and then ſecondly another, obſeruing an order in his wills: I intended it according to my declaration made before, to wit that though all this paſſed in a moſt ſole and moſt ſimple Act: yet in that Act, the order, diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and dependence of things were no leſſe obſerued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in caſe there had bene indeede many Acts in the Vnderſtanding and will of God.

               <p n="2">2. Thus was all things made for that Deified Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who for this cauſe is called THE FIRST BEGOTTEN OF ALL CREATVRS, poſſeſſed by the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in the beginning of his wayes, before he made any thing, created in the beginning before ages:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2765:74"/> For in him all things are made, he is before all, and all things are eſtablished in him, and he is the head of all the Church, hauing the Primacie in, and through all things. The principall reaſon of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vine, is the fruite, and therfore the fruite is the firſt thing deſired and aimed at, though the leaues and the buds are firſt produced. So our great Sauiour was the firſt in the Diuine Intention, and in the Eternall Proiect which the Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence made of the production of Creaturs, and in contemplation of this deſired fruite, the Vine of the world was planted, and the ſucceſsion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations eſtablished which as leaues, or bloſſoms doe preceede it as forerunners, and fit preparatiues for the production of that Grape, which the ſacred Spouſe doth ſo much praiſe in the Canticles and the iuyce of which doth reioyce God and Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But now my THEOTIME who can doubt of the abundance of meanes to ſaluation, hauing ſo great a Sauiour, in conſideration of whom we were made, and by the merits of whom we were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed. For he dyed for all, becauſe all were dead, and his Mercy was more Soueraigne to buie the Race of mortalls, then Adams Miſerie was Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to looſe it. And ſo farre was ADAMS fault from ſurmounting the Diuine Benignitie, that contrariwiſe, it was therby excited and prouoked. So that by a moſt ſweete, and moſt louing ANTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERISTASIS and contention it receiued vigour fuom it's aduerſaries preſence, and as recollecting it's forces to vanquish, it cauſed grace, to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound where iniquitie had abounded. Whence
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2765:75"/> the holy Church by a pious exceſſe of admiration cryes out vpon EASTER EVE, O Sinne of ADAM truly neceſſarie, which was cancelled by the death of IESVS-CHRIST! ô Bleſſed fault, which merited to haue ſuch and ſo great a Redemour! Certes THEOTIME, we may ſaie as did that Auncient; we were loſt, if we had not bene loſt; that is our loſſe brought vs profit, ſythens in effect humane nature hath receiued more graces by the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of her Sauiour, then euer she should haue receiued by Adam's innocencie, if he had perſeuered therin.</p>

For though the Diuine Prouidence hath left in man deepe markes of his anger, yea euen a middeſt the graces of his Mercy, as for example, the neceſsitie of death, ſickneſſe, labours, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the ſenſualitie, yet the Diuine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, hauing the vpper hand of all theſe, takes pleaſure to conuert theſe miſeries, to the greateſt aduantage of ſuch as loue him, making Patience riſe out of their trauailes; the Contempt of the world, out of the neceſsitie of death; a thouſand victories ouer Concupiſcence; and as the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe touching the Thorne ASPALATHVS makes it more odoriferous then the Lillie: ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Redemption touching our miſeries, makes them more profitable, and amiable, then Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Iuſtice could euer haue bene. The Angels in heauen ſaieth our Sauiour, doe more ioy in one penitent ſinner, them in nintie nine iuſt, and ſo the State of Redemption, is an hundred times better then that of Innocencie. Verily by being watered with our Sauiours Blood, cauſed by the

Yet doth he make the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurs of his infinite Bountie more magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, in the incomparable varietie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which we acknowledge in Grace. For THEOTIME he was not content with the holy exceſſe of his Mercy, in ſending to his people, that is to Mankind, a generall and vniuerſall Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by meanes wherof euery one might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but moreouer he diuerſified it in ſo many ſorts, that his Liberalitie did shine amiddeſt that varietie, and that varietie againe did mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish his Lliberalitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And following this, he firſt of all prepared for his moſt holy Mother a fauour, worthy the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2765:76"/> loue of a Sonne, who being moſt wiſe, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and good, was to prouide himſelfe of a Mother to his liking, and thefore he ordained that his Redemption should be applied to her by way of a preſeruatiue to th'end that ſinne, which ranne from generation to generation, might ſtop before it came at her; ſo that she was ranſomed in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a manner, that although the Torrent of originall iniquitie came rolling her vnfortunate waters vpon the Conception of this ſacred Lady, euen with as great impetuoſitie, as againſt the daughters of ADAM; yet being arriued there, it did not dare a further paſſage: but made a ſodaine ſtaie, as did of old, the waters of Iordaine, in the daies of IOSVE and for the ſame reſpect: for the flood ſtopt his courſe in reuerence of the Ark of Alliance which paſſed; and originall ſinne made his waters retire, adoring, and dreading the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the true Tabernacle of Eternall Alliance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this ſort then God deturned all bondage from his glorious Mother, giuing her the good of both the ſtates of humane nature: retaining the Innocencie which the firſt ADAM had loſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying in an excellent ſort the Redemption which the ſecond did acquire. Whence as a garden of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which was to bring fourth the fruite of life, she was made florishing in all ſorts of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; This ſonne of eternall loue, hauing thus decked his Mother with a Robe of gold wrought in faire varietie, that she might be the Queene of his right hand, that is to ſaie, the firſt of the elect, which should enioy the delightes of God's right hand; ſo that this ſacred Mother, as being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2765:76"/> reſerued for her Sonne, was by him infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, not onely from damnation, but euen from all danger of damnation, giuing her Aſſurance of grace, and the Perfection of grace: not vnlike an Aurora who beginning to appeare encreaſeth continually in brightneſſe till perfect day light. Admirable redemption! Maſter-pece of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demour! and Prime of all Redemptions! by which the ſonne with a truly filiall heart, preuented his Mother in the benedictions of ſweetneſſe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued her, not onely from ſinne as he did the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but euen from all danger of ſinne and euery thing that might diuert, of hinder her in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of holy Loue. Proteſting that amongſt all the reaſonable Creaturs he had choſen, this Mother was his onely Doue, his entirely perfect, his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deare well beloued without all paragon, and compariſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God alſo appointed other ſauours for a ſmall number of rare Creaturs, whom he would aſſure from the perill of damnation; as certainly he did S. IOHN BAPTIST, and probably IEREMIE with certaine others, which the Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence ſeaſed vpon in their mothers wombe, and ſtated vpon them a Perpetuitie of Grace, by which they might remaine firme in his Loue, though ſubiect to delaies and veniall ſinnes, which are contrarie to the perfection of Loue, not to Loue it ſelfe, and theſe ſoules in regard of others, are as Queenes continually crowned with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, holding the principall place in the loue of their Sauiour next to his Mother who is Queene of Queenes. A Queene not onely crowned with

Such were the APOSTLES, DAVID, MADELAINE, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe others, who for a time remained out of God's grace, but in the end being throughly conuerted they were confirmed in grace vntill death; ſo that, though from thence they continued ſubiect to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, yet were they exempt from all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne, and conſequently from danger of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Diuine loue, and were as the heauenly ſpouſe his ſacred ſoules, adorned indeede with a wedding garment of this holy loue: yet for all that not crowned; a crowne being an ornament of the head, that is of the prime part of a man: now the firſt yeares of the Soules of this ranck, hauing bene ſubiect to terreane loue, they were not to be adorned with the crowne of heauenly loue, but it is ſufficient for them to weare the Robe which renders them capable of the marriage-bede with the heauenly Spouſe, and to be eternally happie with him.</p>

THere was then in the eternall Prouidence an incomparable fauour for the Queene of Queenes, Mother of faire Dilection, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether moſt entirely perfect. There were alſo for certaine others, ſome ſpeciall fauours. After this the ſoueraigne Bountie poured an abundance of graces, and benedictions vpon the whole race of mankind, and the nature of Angels, with which all were watered, as with a light which illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euery man comming into this world; euery one receiued their portion, as of ſeed which falls not onely vpon the good ground, but vpon the high way, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt thornes, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rockes, that all might be vnexcuſable before the Redeemour, if they should not imploy this moſt aboundant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for their ſoules health.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But albeit THEOTIME that this moſt aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſufficiencie of grace, be thus poured vpon all humane nature; and that in this we are all equall that a rich abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of benedictions is preſented to vs all; yet the varietie of theſe fauours is ſo great, that one cannot ſaie whether the greatneſſe of theſe graces in ſo great a diuerſitie, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie in ſuch greatneſſes be more admirable: For who ſees not that the meanes of Saluation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2765:78"/> Chriſtians are greater, and more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then amongſt Barbarians, and againe, that amongſt Chriſtians, there are People and Townes where the Paſtors are more profitable and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Now to denie that theſe exteriour meanes were benefits of the diuine Prouidence or to doubt whether they did auaile to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and perfection of ſoules, were to be vngratfull to the diuine Bountie, and belye certaine experience, by which we ſee that ordinarily where theſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour helpes abound, the interiour are more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, and ſucceede better.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certes as we ſee, that there are neuer found two men perfectly reſembling th'one thother in naturall giftes, ſo are there neuer any found wholy equall in ſupernaturall ones. The Angels, as great S. AVGVSTINE and S. THOMAS aſſure vs, receiued grace with proportion to the varietie of their naturall conditions. Now they are all either of a different ſpecies or at leaſt of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being they are diſtinguished one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: therfore according to the diuerſitie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, there are different graces. And though grace is not giuen to men according to their naturall conditions, yet the diuine ſweeteneſſe ioyeth, and as one would ſaie exulteth in the production of graces, infinitly diuerſifying them, to the end that out of his varietie, the faire enamell of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and mercy might appeare: whence the Church vpon the Feaſts of euery Confeſſour and Bishop doth ſing: There was not found the like to him; and as in heauen none knowes the new name, ſaue him that receiues it, becauſe ech
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2765:78"/> one of the Bleſſed, hath his owne a part, according to the new beeing of glorie which he attained. So in earth, euery one doth receiue a grace ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that all are diuerſe. Our Sauiour doth alſo compare his grace to Pearles, which as Plinnie ſaith, are otherwiſe called Vnions, becauſe euery one of them are ſo ſingular in their qualities, that neuer two of them are found perfectly like. And as one ſtarre is different from another in brightneſſe, ſo shall one paſſe another in glorie, a ſure ſigne of their aduantage in Grace. Now this varietie in Grace, or this grace in varietie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a moſt ſacred beautie, and moſt ſweete har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, reioyſing all the holy citie of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hieruſalem.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But we muſt be very warie neuer to make enquirie, why the ſupreame wiſdome beſtowes a GRACE rather vpon one the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, nor why she makes her fauours abound rather in one behalfe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. No THEOTIME, neuer enter into this curioſitie: For hauing all of vs ſufficiently, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, that which is requiſite to ſaluation, what reaſon can any creature liuing haue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, if it pleaſe God to beſtow his graces more amply vpon one then another? If one should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, why God made MELONS greater then STRAWBEARIES, or LYLIES greater then VIOLETS, why ROSMARIE is not a ROSE, or why the Cloue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillow flour is not a Turneſole: why the Peacocke is more beautifull then the Rate, or why the Figue is ſweete and the Lemma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſourishe, one would laugh at ſuch demandes, and ſaie; poore man, ſith the beautie of the world doth require varietie, it is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2765:79"/> neceſſarie there should be difference, and inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in things, and that the one should not be thother? For which cauſe the one is little, th'other great: the one bitter, the other ſweete: the one more, the other leſſe faire. Now, it is the ſame in ſupernaturall things: euery one hath his gifte, one thus and another thus, ſaieth the Holy Ghoſt. It is then an impertinencie to ſearch, why S. PAVLE had not the grace of S. PETER; or S. PETER that of S. PAVLE; why S. ANTONIE was not S. ATHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NASIVS; or he, S.

For this cauſe THEOTIME the ſweete IESVS who bought vs with his blood, deſireth infinitly that we should loue him, that we might eternally be ſaued, and deſires we might be ſaued, that we might loue him eternally, his loue tending to our ſaluation, and our ſaluation to his loue. Ah ſaieth he, I came to put fire into the world, to what end, but that it should burne; But to ſet out more to the life the vehemencie of his deſire, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs this loue in admirable termes. Thou shalt loue ſaieth he the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy force, this is the firſt and greateſt Commandement. Good God THEOTIME how amourous the diuine heart is of our loue, had it not bene ſufficient to haue published a permiſsion, by which we might haue had leaue to loue him: as LABAN permitted Iacob to loue his faire RACHEL, and to gaine her by ſeruices? ah no! he made a further declaration of his amourous paſsion of loue to vs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes vs to loue him with all our powre, leaſt the conſideration of his maieſtie, and our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, which puts vs in ſo great a diſtance, and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, or other pretext whatſoeuer, might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert vs from his loue: In which THEOTIME he well shewes that he did not leaue in vs a naturall inclination to loue for nothing: For to th'end it might not be idle, he vrgeth vs by this generall commandement to imploy it, and to th'end this commandement might haue effect he furniſeth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2765:80"/> euery liuing creature abundantly with all meanes requiſite thervnto. The viſible Sunne toucheth euery thing with his liuely heate, and as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon louer of things belowe, doth impart vnto them requiſite vigour to produce. And euen ſo the diuine goodneſſe doth animate all ſoules and encourage all hearts to her loue, none at all being shut vp from her heate. The eternall wiſdome ſayeth Salomon preacheth in publicke, she makes her voice reſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the places, she cries a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries before the people, she pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth her words in the gates of the Citie, ſaying ô children how long will it be, that you will loue your infancie? how long will fooles deſire hurtfull things? and the imprudent hate knowledge?

Let no man ſaye I am dead in ſinne, and how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I recouer life againe? Ah no! for harke, God ſaieth, I am liuing, and as true as I liue, I will not the death of a ſinner but that he be conuerted and liue. Now, to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God, is to loue, and he that loues not remaines in death; See now THEOTIME whether God doth not deſire we should loue him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But he is not content to denounce in this manner publickly his great deſire to be loued, ſo that euery one might receiue a part of the ſeedes of his loue, but he goes euen from doore to doore, knocking and beating; proteſting that if any one open, he will enter, and ſuppe with him; that is, he will teſtifie all ſorts of good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

Conuert your ſelues, conuert your ſelues, doe penance, returne to me, liue, why doſt thou die ô houſe of Iſrael? In concluſion this heauenlie Sauiour forgets nothing, to shew that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes are aboue all his workes, that his mercy doth ſurpaſſe his Iudgment, that his Redemption is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, that his loue is infinite, and as the Apoſtle ſaieth, that he is rich in mercy, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that his will is, that all men should be ſaued, none perish.</p>

And truely we should well deſerue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine abandoned of God, ſith we haue diſloyally abandoned him but his eternall charitie doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not permit his iuſtice to vſe this chaſtiſement, but exciting his compaſsion, prouokes him to reclaime vs from our miſerie, which he doth by ſending vnto vs the fauorable wind of his moſt holy inſpiration, which blowing vpon our hearts with a ſweete violence, doth ſeaſe and ſtirre them, aduancing our thoughtes, and eleuating our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections into the ayre of heauenly loue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now this firſt ſtirring or motion, which God, cauſeth in our hearts, to incite them to their owne good, is effected indeede in vs, but not by vs; for it cometh vnexpectedly before we either haue, or could haue thought of it, ſeeing we haue not any ſufficiencie of our ſelues, as of our ſelues, to thinke any thing neceſſarie to our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but all our abilitie is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, who did not onely loue vs before we were, but euen to th'end we might be,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2765:82"/> and become Saincts; For which cauſe, he doth preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs with the bleſsings of his fatherly ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and doth excitate our hearts, to bring them to a holy repentance and conuerſion. See, I pray you THEOT: the poore Apoſtle, ſtupid with ſinne in the heauie night of his Maiſters paſſion; he did no more thinke to ſorrow for his ſinne, then though he had neuer knowen his heauenly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: and as a miſerable Apode fallen vpon the ground had neuer riſen, had not the Cocke, as an inſtrument of the diuine prouidence, ſtruke his eares with his voice, at the ſame inſtante in which his ſweete Redeemour caſting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a gracious looke as a dart of loue, tranſpearced his heart of loue, whence afterwards did iſſue water in ſuch abundance, as did fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auncient Rocke ſmot by Moyſes in the Deſert. But looke againe and ſee this holy Apoſtle ſleeping in Herods Priſon, chained in two chaines; he is there in qualitie of a Martyr, and neuertheleſſe he repreſenteth poore man, ſleeping, enuironed with ſinne, priſoner and ſlaue to Satan. Alas who will deliuer him? The Angell deſcends from heauen, and ſtriking vpon the great empriſoned Peters ſide, awakes him, ſaying, vp, ariſe; and the inſpiration comes from heauen as an Angell, and hitting right vpon the poore ſinners heart, ſtirs him vp, that he might riſe from his iniquitie. Is it not true then ô my deare THEOT: that this firſt motion and touch which the ſoule perceiueth, when God preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with loue, doth awake and excite it to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſinne returning vnto him; and not onely the firſt touch but euen the whole awaking is done in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2765:83"/> vs and for vs, but not by vs? We are awaked, but not of our ſelues; it was the inſpiration which wakened vs, and to make vs riſe, did moue and shake vs, I ſlept ſaieth the deuote Spouſe, and my SPOVSE who is my Heart, watched. Ah! ſee him heare how he awakes me calling me by the title of our loues, I know well by his voice, t'is he. It is at vnawares a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnexpectedly that God doth call and ſtirs vs vp by his holy inſpiration. And in this beginning of grace, we doe nothing, but feele the touch which God giues in vs indeede as S. BER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RARD ſaieth, but without our concourſe.</p>

VVoe be to thee COROSAIN, woe be to thee BETHSAIDA: For if in TIRIA and SIDONIA the Miracles had bene done which were done in thee, they had done penance in haire cloth and ashes; t'is the word of God; Harke I pray you THEOT: how the inhabitants of COROSAIN, and BETSAIDA, inſtructed in the true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and poſſeſſed of fauours, that would euen haue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pagans themſelues, remaine neuertheleſſe obſtinate neuer making vſe therof, but reiecting this holy light, by an incomparable rebellion. Certainely at the day of iudgment, the NINIVITS and the Queene Saba will riſe vp againſt the Iewes, and will conuince them to be worthy of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2765:83"/> For as touching the NINIVITS they being Idolatours, and Barbarians, at the voice of IONAS were conuerted and did penance; And the Queene of SABA, though engaged in the affairs of her kingdome: yet hauing heard the renowne of SALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS wiſdome, she forſooke all, to goe to heare him ſpeake. While the IEWES, hearing with their eares the heauenly wiſdome of the true SALO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON Sauiour, of the world; ſeeing with their eies his miracles; touching with their hands his graces and benefits, ceaſed not for all that to be hardned, and to reſiſt the grace which was profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. See then againe THEOT: how they who had fewer drawings are brought to penance, and thoſe who had more remaine obdurate: Thoſe who had leſſe occaſion to come, come to wiſdomes ſchoole: and thoſe who had more, ſticke in their follie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus is the iudgment of compariſon made, as all the Doctours haue noted, which can haue no foundation, if it conſiſt not in this, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome haue had as many, or more callings, then others haue, they denyed conſent to God's mercy, whereas others aſsiſted with the like, yea euen leſſer helpes, haue followed the inſpiration betaking themſelues to holy penance: For how could one otherwiſe reaſonably reproach the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent with their impenitencie, by compariſon to ſuch as are conuerted?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certainly our Sauiour doth clearly shew, and all Chriſtians doe in ſimplicitie conceiue, that in this iuſt iudgment the Iewes shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by compariſon to the NINIVITS; becauſe thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2765:84"/> receiued many fauours, and yet loued not: much aſsiſtance, and yet repented not; theſe, leſſe fauour, and yet loued much: leſſe aſsiſtance, and yet ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed much.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great S. AVGVSTINE giues great light to this diſcourſe by a paſſage of his in the 12. booke of the Citie of God, 6. 7. 8. and 9. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for though he haue there a particular reference to Angels, yet ſo, as that he makes a paritie in this pointe, betwixt them and men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now, after he had in the ſixt chapter put two men, entirely equall in goodneſſe and all things, moleſted with the ſame temptation, he preſuppoſeth that the one could reſiſt, the other giue way to the enemy: in the 9. chapter hauing proued that all the Angels were created in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, auerring further as a thing probable, that grace and charitie was equall in them all; he makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand how it came to paſſe, that ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerd, and made progreſſe in goodneſſe euen to the attaining of glorie, others forſooke good, to imbrace euill, euen to damnation. And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, that no other anſwere can be rendred, then that the one companie perſeuered by the grace of their Creatour: the other, of good which they were, became bad by their owne onely will.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if it be true, as S. THOMAS doth ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well prooue, that grace was diuerſified in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with proportion, and according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their naturall giftes, the Seraphins should haue had a grace incomparably more excellent, then the ſimple Angels of the laſt Order: How then happened it, that ſome of the Seraphins, yea
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2765:84"/> euen the firſt of all, according to the common and moſt probable opinion of the auncients, did fall, while an innumerable multitude of other Angels, inferiour in nature and grace, did brauely and couragiouſly perſeuer? How came it to paſſe that Lucifer, excellent by nature, and ſuperexcellent by grace fell and ſo many Angels with leſſe aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ſtood to theire fidelitie. Truely ſuch as ſtood ought to render the praiſe therof to God, who of his mercy created and maintained them good: But to whom can Lucifer and all his crew, aſcribe their fall, if not as S. PAVLE ſaieth, to their owne will, which, by her libertie deuorced her ſelfe from God's grace that had ſo ſweetely preuented her? How art thou fallen ô great Lucifer, who euen like a faire morning, came out into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible world, clothed with prime charitie, as from the beginning of the brightneſſe of a faire day, who ought to encreaſe till the mid-day of eternall glorie? Thou didſt not want grace, which correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondant to thy nature, thou hadſt moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all; but thou waſt awanting to grace. God did not depriue thee of the operation of his loue, but thou depriued his loue of thy cooperation: God had neuer reiected thee, if thou hadſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected his loue; O moſt good God, thou doſt not forſake, vnleſſe forſaken: thou neuer recalls thy giftes till we recall our hearts.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="1">1.

Be the fountaine neuer ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, her ſtreames enter not into a garden accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their plentie, but in a meaſure, according to the littleneſſe or amplitude of the chanell, by which they are conducted thither. And though the holy ghoſt, as a ſource of liue-water doth driue vpon our hearts euery ſide, to water them with his graces, yet ſo as he will not haue them enter without the free conſent of our will. He will not pouer them out, but according to his good pleaſure, and our owne diſpoſition and coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Holy Councell ſaieth, which alſo as I ſuppoſe, by reaſon of the correſpondance betwixt our conſent and grace, calls the receit therof a free receit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this ſenſe, S. PAVLE exhorteth vs not to receiue God's grace in vaine. For as a ſicke man, who hauing receiued the potion in his hand, and should not take it into his ſtomacke, should true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue receiued the potio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet without receiuing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2765:85"/> it, that is, he receiued it in an vnprofitable and fruitleſſe ſort, ſo we receiue the grace of God in vaine, when we receiue it at the gate of our heart, without permitting it to enter into our hearts conſent: for ſo we receiue it without receiuing it to wit, we receiue it without fruit, ſith it auails nothing to feele the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnleſſe we conſent vnto it. And as the ſicke man, who had the potion giuen into his hand, if he tooke it not wholy but in part onely, had alſo the operation therof in part onely, not wholy: ſo when God ſends a great and puiſſant inſpiration to imbrace his loue, if we conſent not according to it's whole amplitude, it will but profit vs in the ſame meaſure. It happens often, that being inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe much, we conſent not to the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, but onely to ſome part therof, as did thoſe good people in the Goſpell, who vpon the inſpiration, which God gaue them to follow him, made reſeruations, the one, to goe firſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre his father; the other, to take leaue of his friends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As long as the poore widow had emtie veſſells, the oyle, whoſe multiplication HELISEVS did miraculouſly impetrate, neuer left running; but when she had no more, to receiue it in, it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to flow. In the ſame meaſure in which our heart dilats it ſelfe, or rather, in the meaſure, in which it permits it ſelfe to be amplified and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, not denying the freedome of it's co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to Gods mercy, he ſtreames out continually, and without delay poures in his ſacred inſpirations, which ſtill increaſe, and make vs increaſe more and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2765:86"/> more in heauenly loue. But when there is no more freedome left; or that we giue no further conſent, he ſtaies their courſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What is the reaſon then we are not ſo much aduanced in the loue of God, as was S. AVGVSTINE S. FRANCIS, S. CATHERINE of GENVA, or SAINT FRANCISCA: THEOT: it is, becauſe God gaue vs not the grace; and why did not God giue vs the grace? for that we did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ply as we ought with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations. And why did we not comply? Becauſe hauing libertie, we did therin abuſe it. But why did we abuſe our libertie? Ah THEO: we muſt ſtop there: For, as S. AVGVSTINE ſaieth, the depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our will, proceeds from no cauſe but from the defect of a cauſe, which cauſeth the ſinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The deuote brother RVFIN, vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine viſion which he had of the glorie which the great S. FRANCIS should attaine vnto, by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, made him this demande: my deare father, I beſeech you tell me in earneſt, what opinion you haue of your ſelfe: The Sainte anſwered, verily I hould my ſelfe the greateſt ſinner in the world, and one which ſerueth God the leaſt. But brother RVFIN replied, how can you ſaie that in truth and conſcience, ſeeing that many others, as we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſee, commit many great ſinnes, from which God bethanked you are exempt? To which SAINT FRANCIS anſwered; if God, ſaieth he, had fauored thoſe others of whom you ſpeake, with ſo great mercy as he hath me, certaine I am, be they neuer ſo bad now, they had bene farre more acknowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of God's giftes, then I am; and would ſerue him much better then I doe; and if my God did
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2765:86"/> abandon me, I should commit more wickednes then they.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſee THEOT: the opinion of this man, who indeede was rather no man, but a Seraphin vpon earth, I know it was humilitie that moued him to ſpeake thus of himſelfe, yet neuertheleſſe he beleeued for a certaine trueth, that an equall grace granted by a like mercy, might be more fruitfully imploied by one ſinner then by another. Now I hould for an Oracle the feeling of this great doctour in the ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Saints, who brought vp in the ſchoole of the Croſſe, breathed nothing but diuine inſpirations. This Apothegme hath alſo bene praiſed, and repeated by the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoteſt that followed him, amongſt which, diuerſe are of opinion, that the great Apoſtle S.

I Will not heare ſpeake my deare THEOT: of thoſe miraculous graces, which haue almoſt in an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, transformed wolfes into shepsheards, Rockes into waters, perſecutors into preachers; I'le leaue a part thoſe all-powerfull vocations, and holily violent draughts by which God hath brought ſome elect ſoules, from the extreamitie of vice, to the extreamitie of grace, working, as it were in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a certaine TRANSSVBTANTIATION morall and ſpirituall, as it happned to the great Apoſtle, who of SAVLE veſſell of perſecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Sodainly PAVLE veſſell of election. We muſt giue a particular rancke to thoſe priuileged ſoules vpon whom it pleaſed God to exerciſe not a meere abundance, but an inundation, and if one may ſo ſaie, not a liberalitie onely or a meere owerflowing but euen a prodigalitie and lauishing out of his loue. The diuine iuſtice doth chaſtiſe vs in this world with punishments, which as they are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, ſo they remaine alwaies in a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen and imperceptible, yet ſometimes he ſends out Deluges and Abiſſes of punishments, to make knowen, and dreaded the ſeueritie of his indignation: In like manner, the diuine Mercy doth ordinarily conuert, and gratifie ſoules ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2765:87"/> ſweetely, gently, and delicatly, that his motion is ſcarcely perceiued, and yet it happens againe, that his ſoueraigne bountie ouerflowing his ordinarie bankes, (as a flood ſwollen and ouercharged with the aboundance of waters, which breaketh ouer the plaine) ſtreames out his graces, ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly though louingly, that in a moment he doth water and couer a ſoule with benedictions, that the riches of his loue may appeare; and as his iuſtice proceedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the ordinarie way, and but ſeldome the extraordinarie; ſo his mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth liberalitie vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort of men the ordinarie way, and but vpon ſome few onely the extraordinarie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But which are then the ordinarie lines wherby the diuine prouidence is accuſtomed to draw our hearts to his loue? Such truly as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth deſigne deſcribing the meanes which he vſed to draw the people of Iſrael out of Egipte, and out of the deſert vnto the land of Promiſſe: I will draw them ſaieth he by OSEE, with lines of humanitie, charitie, and loue. Doubtleſſe THEOT: we are not drawen to God by Iron chaines, as Bulls and Bufflers: but by enticements, delicious touches and holy inſpirations, which in ſome, are the lines of ADAM and humanitie; that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and ſquared to humane hearts, where libertie is naturall: the property of mans heart, is delight and pleaſure; we show Nuts to children ſaieth S. AVGVSTINE, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they are drawen in louing them, they are drawen by the line, not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but of the heart. Marke then how the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall father drawes vs, by teaching he delightes vs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2765:88"/> not by impoſing vpon vs any neceſsitie, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth into our hearts delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſpirituall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as ſacred baits by which he ſweetely drawes vs to take and taſt the ſweeteneſſe of his doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this ſort then, deareſt THEO: our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will is in no wiſe forced, or neceſsitated by grace; but notwithſtanding the moſt powerfull vigour of Gods mercifull hand, which toucheth, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and ties the ſoule with ſuch a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, ſeades, and draughtes, this humane will remaines franke and free, and exempt from all conſtrainte and neceſsitie. Grace is ſo gracious and ſo graciouſly ſeaſeth our hearts to draw them, that she offends nothing in the libertie of our will: she toucheth powerfully, but yet ſo delicatly the parts of our heart, that our free will receiues no force therby: she hath forces, not to force, but to entice the heart, she is holily violent, not to violate, but to make our libertie beloued. She acteth ſtrongly, yet ſo ſweetely, that our will doth not remaine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſo powerfull an action, she preſſeth, but oppreſſeth not our libertie, ſo that amiddeſt theſe forces, we haue power to conſent, or diſſent from her motions, according to our liking. But that which is no leſſe admirable then true, is, that when our will followeth the draught, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the diuine motion, she followeth no leſſe freely, then freely she doth reſiſt, when she reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth: although the conſent to grace, depends much more of grace, then of the will, and that the reſiſtance of grace, depends vpon the will onely, ſo amiable is Gods hand in the hadling of our hearts; ſo dexterous it is in communicating vnto vs its
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2765:88"/> force, without depriuing vs of libertie; and in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting vnto vs the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his power, without im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the motion of our will; adding power to ſweetneſſe; in ſuch ſort, that as in good things his power doth ſweetly giue vs force, ſo his ſweetneſſe doth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine powerfully the freedome of our will. If thou knew the gift of God, ſaied our Sauiour to the Samaritane, and who he is who ſaieth vnto thee giue me to drinke, thou thy ſelfe peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture wouldſt haue aſked him, and he had giuen thee liue-water. See I praie you, THEO: the touch of our Sauiour when he ſignifies his drawings: If thou knewſt, would he ſaie, the gift of God, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou wouldſt be moued and drawen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the water of eternall life, and perchance thou wouldſt demand it: as though he had ſaied, thou shouldſt haue power and motion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet in no wiſe be forced or conſtained: but onely, perchance, thou would demand it; for thy libertie would remaine to demand or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. Such are our Sauiours words according to the vulgar edition, and according to S. AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE vpon S. IOHN.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conclud, if any should ſaie, that our free-will doth not cooperate in conſenting to the grace, with which God doth preuent her: or that she could not reiect, and denie it conſent, he should contradict the whole Scripture, all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, experience, and be excommunicated by the Concell of Trent. But when it is ſaied that we haue power to reiect the diuine inſpirarions and motions, there is no ſuch meaning at all, as that one may hinder God to inſpire vs, or touch
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2765:89"/> our hearts; for as I haue already ſaied, that is done in vs without our helpe. Theſe are fauours which God beſtowes vpon vs, before we haue once thought on them: he awakes vs when we ſleepe: and conſequently we find our ſelues awake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we thought on't, but it is in our power to riſe or not to riſe; and though he haue awaked vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs, he will not raiſe vs without vs. Now not to riſe is to reſiſt the call, and ſleepe againe, ſeeing we were called onely to th'end we should riſe. We cannot hinder that the inſpiration thruſt vs not on, and conſequently put vs not into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but if as it driues vs forwards, we repulſe it by not yeelding our ſelues to its motion, we then make reſiſtance; ſo the winde hauing ſeaſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mounted our Apodes, will not beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre vnleſſe they diſplay their winges, and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate raiſing themſelues, and ſoaring vp a loft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aire, toward which the winde began their motion: but if contrariwiſe taken, as it happens, with ſome pray they eſpie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fium'd with their delay there, in lieu of ſeconding the winde, they keepe their winges foulded and doe caſt themſelues againe vpon the earth: they receiued indeede the motion of the winde, but in vaine ſith they did not helpe themſelues therby. THEO: inſpirations doe preuent vs, and euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be thought on make themſelues be felt, but after we haue felt them, it is in our hand's either to conſent to them, to ſecond and follow their motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else to diſſent and repell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Euen ſo, my deare THEO: when an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, as a ſacred gale, blowes vs forward in the aire of holy loue, it firſt laies at our will, and by the ſenſe of ſome heauenly delectation moues, vnfolds, and extends the naturall inclination which she hath to good: ſo that it ſerues it ſelfe of this inclination as a hold to faſten vpon the ſoule, and all this as I haue ſaied is done in vs, without vs: for it is the diuine fauour, that doth preuent vs in this ſort. But if our will thus holily preuented, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the winges of her inclination moued, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, extended, ſtirred and agitated by this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly winde, doe in any meaſure contribute her conſent, ah how happie she is THEO: for the ſame inſpiration, and fauour which hath ſeaſed vs, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p n="2">2. Sweete God THEO: what a conſolation it is to conſider the ſacred methode with which the Holy Ghoſt pouers into our ſoules the firſt rayes and feelings of his light, and vitall heate! O IESVS how delightfull a pleaſure it is, to marke how the diuine loue goes by little and little; by degrees which inſenſibly become ſenſible, diſplaying his light vpon a ſoule, neuer diſiſting till he haue wholy couered it with the ſplendour of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, endewing it in the end with the perfect beautie of his day! ô how cheerefull, faire, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and agreeable this day-breake is! Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe true it is, that either this breake of day is not day, or if it be day, it is but a beginning day, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the day, and rather the infancie of the day then the day it ſelfe. In like manner, without doubt theſe motions of loue which forerunne the act of faith requiſite to our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are either not loue properly ſpeaking, or but a beginning and imperfect loue. They are the firſt verdant bloſſomes, which the ſoule warmed with the heauenly Sunne, as a myſticall tree begins to put fourth in ſpring time which are rather preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of fruite then fruite it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. S. PACOMIVS, as then a young ſouldier and ignorant of God, enrolled vnder the colours of the armie, which CONSTANCE had leuied againſt the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2765:90"/> Tyrant MAXENTIVS, came with the Companie with whom he was to lodge nigh a little towne, not farre diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Thebes, where not onely he, but all the armie were in extreame want of victualls; which the inhabitants of the little towne hauing vnderſtoode, being by good fortune Chriſtians, and conſequently friendly and charitable to their neighbours, they ſodainly ſuccoured the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in their neceſſitie; and that with ſuch care, courtifie, and affection, that PACOMIVS was ſtrucke with admiration therat, and dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was that was ſo bountifull, amiable and gracious, it was anſwered him, they were Chriſtians; and enquiring againe, of what law, and manner of life they were, he learned that they beleeued in IESVS CHRIST the onely ſonne of God, and did good to all ſorts of people, with a firme hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen of God himſelfe, an ample recompenſe therof. Alas THEOT: the poore PACOMIVS, though of a good nature, was then laied a ſleepe in the beed of his infidelitie, and behould how vpon a ſodaine, God was preſent at the port of his heart, and by the good example of theſe Chriſtians, as by a ſweete voice he calls him, awakes him and giues him the firſt Feelings of the little heate of his loue for ſcarcely had he heard, as I haue ſaied, the ſweete law of our Sauiour intimated, till filled with a new light, and interiour conſolation, retiring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a part, and hauing for a ſpace muſed, he lifted vp his hands towards heauen, and with a profound ſigh, fell into this ſpeach. Lord God who made heauen and earth, if thou deigne to caſt thine eies vpon my baſeneſſe, and miſerie, and giue me the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2765:91"/> knowledge of thy diuinitie, I promiſſe to ſerue thee, and obey thy commandements all the daies of my life. From this praier and promiſſe, the loue of the true good, and pietie did ſo encreaſe in him, that he ceaſed not to practiſe, a thouſand thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d acts of vertue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Verily me thinkes I ſee in this example, a Nightingale who waking at the peepe of the day begins to ſtirre vp, and ſtrech her ſelfe, vnfould her plumes, skipe from branch to branch amidſt the thickets, and chirpe out her delicious notes. For did you not note, how the good example of the charitable Chriſtians, did excitate and ſtirre vp by manner of ſurpriſe the bleſſed PACOMIVS; Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the amaiſement of admiration wherwith he was taken, was no other thing, then his awaking. At which God touched him, as doth the Sunne the earth with a raie of his heate, which filled him with a great feeling of ſpirituall pleaſure. For which cauſe PACOMIVS did a little diuert himſelfe: To th'end he might with more attention and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie recollect, and relish the grace he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, withdrawing himſelfe to thinke thervpon: then he extends his heart and hands towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whether the inſpiration drawes him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to diſplaie the winges of his affections, flying betwixt the diffide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which he hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which he repoſeth in God he intons in an ayre humbly amourous, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his conuerſion, by which he teſtifieth, that euen already he knew one onely God Creatour of heauen and earth: but withall he knew that he did not know him ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to ſerue him as he ought
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2765:91"/> and therefore he petitions, that a more perfect knowledg may be imparted vnto him, that therby he may come to the perfect ſeruice of his diuine maieſtie:</p>
               <p n="4">4. Behould in the interim, I beſeech you THEO: how God in a ſweete manner fortifieth by little and little the grace of his inſpiration in the conſenting hearts, drawing them after him, as it were ſtepp by ſtepp, vpon this IACOBS ladder. But of what ſort are his drawhtes? The firſt, by which he doth preuent, and awake vs, is his worke in vs, without our cooperation; All the other, are his works, and in vs, but not without our concourſe. Draw me ſaied the ſacred ſpouſe, that is, begin thou firſt; for I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not awake of my ſelfe, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not moue, vnleſſe thou moue me; but when thou shalt once haue giuen motion, then ô thou deare Spouſe of my heart, we runne, we two, thou runns before me drawing me ſtill forward: and as for me, I will follow thee in thy courſe, conſenting to thy draught: but let no man thinke that thou haiſt me after the by compulſion, as a ſlaue, or as a liueleſſe charret; ah no, thou drawes me by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of thy perfumes; though I follow thee, it is not that thou trayles me; but that thou doſt intice me; thy drawghtes are puiſſant, but no way violent, ſith their whole force, is placed in their ſweeteneſſe; Perfumes haue no other force to draw men to follow them, then their ſweeteneſſe; and how could ſweeteneſſe draw, but ſweetely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Good God THEO: may I well ſaie this? Faith is the great friend of our vnderſtanding, and may iuſtly ſaie to humane ſciences, which vante they are more cleare then she, as did the ſacred ſpouſe to the shepheards. I am black, yet faire, ô humane diſcourſes of ſciences acquired; I am black, for I am ſeated amongſt the obcurities of ſimple reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which haue no appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but makes me looke blacke, putting me well nigh out of knowledge: yet I am faire in my ſelfe, by reaſon of my infinite, certaintie, and if mortall eies could behould me ſuch as I am by nature, they would finde me entirely faire: And muſt it not neceſſarily follow that in effect I am infinitly amiable, ſince that the gloomie darkneſſe, and thicke miſtes amongſt which I am, not viewed but onely ENTER-VIEVVED, could not hinder me to be ſo agreeable, but that the vnderſtanding priſing me aboue all things, and breaking the preſſe of other knowledges cauſed way be made vnto me, and receiued me as his Queene into he moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime throne of his Pallace, from whence I giue lawes to all ſciences, and doe keepe, all diſcourſe and humane ſenſe vnder: yea verily THEO: euen as the Commanders of the Armie of Iſrael ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping themſelues, put all their clothes in a heape, and made them as a royall throne, vpon which they placed IEHV, crying IEHV is kinge, ſo at

The IEWES ſaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and heard the wonders of our Sauiour, but being indiſpoſed to receiue faith, that is, their will not being capable of the ſweeteneſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of faith, by reaſon of the bitterneſſe and malice, with which they were filled, they perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in their infidelitie.

               <p n="3">3. You haue heard THEO: that in generall Councels there are great diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and inquiries made of truth by diſcourſe, reaſon, and theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall arguments, but the matters being diſcuſſed, the FATHERS, that is the Bishops, but eſpecially the

The inquiſition then and the diſputation is made in the PORCES by Prieſtes and Doctours, but the reſolution and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is paſſed in the SANCTVARIE where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt which animateth the bodie of his Church ſpeaketh by the mouth of the head thereof: In like manner the Oſtridg layes her egges vpon the Libian shore, but the Sunne alone doth hatch her young ones.

Faith makes vs know by an infallible certaintie that God is; that he is infinite in bountie; that he can communicate himſelfe vnto vs; and not onely that he can, but that he will; ſo that by an ineffable ſweeteneſſe he hath prouided vs of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to obtaine the happineſſe of eternall glorie.

Mans heart tends to God by his naturall inclination, without diſcerning well who he is, but when he finds him at the fountaine of faith, and ſeeth him ſo good, faire, ſweete, and gentle towards all, and ſo prone, as ſoueraigne good, to beſtow himſelfe vpon all which deſire him, ô God what content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and what ſacred motions hath the ſoule to vnite her ſelfe for euer to this bountie ſo ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly amiable?

We ſomtimes experience in our ſelues cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnexpected delights, without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe, and theſe are diuers times preſages of ſome greater ioyes, whence many are of opinion that our good Angell fore-ſeeing the good which shall arriue vnto vs, giues vs by this meanes a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt therof, as contrariwiſe he ſtrikes into vs with

Euen ſo my deare THEO: our heart hauing had for ſo long a time an inclination to it's ſoueraigne good, knew not to what end this motion tended: But ſo ſoone as faith hath ſet it at view, then the heart doth clearly diſcerne, that it was that which his ſoule coueted, his vnderſtanding ſerched, and his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation aymed at. Certainly whether we wake, or ſleepe, our ſoule tends toward the ſoueraigne good: but what is this ſoueraigne good? we are like to theſe good ATHENIANS, who ſacrificed vnto the true God albeit vnknowen vnto them, till the great S.

                  </q> This deſire is iuſt, THEO: for who would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſo deſirable a good? But this deſire would be vnprofitable, yea would be a continuall torment to our heart, if we had not aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that we should at length ſatiate it, he, who, becauſe he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied in the poſſeſſion of this happineſſe, proteſted that his teares were his ordinarie bread night and day, ſo long as his God was abſent, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies demanded where is thy God, Alas what would he haue done, if he had not had ſome hope one day to enioye this good after which he ſighed. The Diuine ſpouſe, wailes and pines with loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she doth not readily find out the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued she ſearcheth for. The loue of the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued had bred in her a deſire: that deſire begot an ardour to purſue it: and that ardour, cauſed in her a languishment, which had conſumed, and annihilated her poore heart, vnleſſe she had hoped at length to meete with that she purſued: So then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2765:96"/> leaſt the vnreſt, and dolourous langour which the eſſaies of coueting loue cauſeth in our ſoules, might make vs quaile in courage or carrie vs to diſpare, the ſame ſouueraigne good, which moues in vs ſo vehement a deſire, doth alſo giue vs aſſurance, that we may with eaſe obtaine it, by a thouſand thouſand promiſſes which he giues vs therof in his holy word and by his inſpirations, alwayes prouided, that we will imploy the meanes he hath prepared for vs, and which he offers vs to this effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now theſe diuine promiſes and aſſurances, by a particular miracle encreaſe the cauſe of our diſquiete, and according to that augmentation, they ruinate and deſtroy the effects; yea verily THEO. for the aſſurance which GOD giues vs, that Paradice is for vs, doth infinitly fortifie the deſire we haue to enioye it, and yet doth weaken, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together diſtroy the trouble and diſquiet which this deſire brought vnto vs, ſo that our hearts, by the promiſes which the diuine goodneſſe hath made vs, remaine quieted, and this quiete is the roote of the moſt holy vertue, which we call hope. For the will aſſured by faith, that she hath power to enioye the ſoueraigne good, vſing the meanes appointed, makes two great acts of vertue; by the one, she expects from God the fruition of his ſoueraigne goodneſſe, by the other, she aſpires to that holy fruition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And indeede THEO: betwixt hoping and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, there is but this difference, that we hope for things which we expect by an others aſſiſtance, and we aſpire vnto thoſe things which we thinke
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2765:97"/> to atchiue of our ſelues, by our owne endeuours: and for ſo much as we attaine the fruition of our ſoueraigne good, which is GOD, by his fauour, grace and mercy; and that notwithſtanding the ſaied mercy will haue vs cooperate with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, by contributing the weakneſſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the ſtrength of her grace; our hope is thence in ſome ſort mixed with aſpiration, ſo that we doe not altogether hope without aſpiring, nor doe we euer aſpire without altogeither hopeing, in which, hope keeps the principall place, as being founded vpon heauenly grace: without which like as we cannot euen ſo much as thinke of our ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good in ſuch ſort as we ought to arriue there; ſo can we neuer without hope in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent manner aſpire to the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our aſpiration then is a young shoot of hope, as is our cooperation of grace, and as thoſe that would hope without aſpiring, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected as degenerous and negligent, ſo thoſe that should aſpire without hopeing would be rash, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and preſumptious: but when hope is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with aſpiration, and that hopeing we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and aſpiring we hope, then deare THEO: hope by aſpiration becomes a couragious deſine, and aſpiration is changed by hope into an humble pretention while we hope and aſpire as GOD shall inſpire vs. Howbeit as well the one as the other is cauſed by the coueting loue, tending, to our ſoueraigne good, which by how much more ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is hoped for, by ſo much it is more affected: yea hope is no other thing then a complacence of loue, which we take in the expectation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2765:97"/> of our ſoueraigne good. All that is there is loue TH. As ſoone as faith had showe me my ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good I loued it, which becauſe it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I deſired it, and hauing vnderſtood that he would beſtow himſelfe vpon me, I loued and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him yet more ardently; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d indeede his bountie is ſo much more to be beloued, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deſired, by how much it is more prone to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate it ſelfe. Now by this progreſſe loue turned his deſire into hope, pretention and expectation, ſo that hope is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and attending loue, and becauſe the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good which hope expects, is God, whom alſo she doth not expect but from God himſelfe, to whom and by whom she doth hope and aſpire, this holy vertue of hope bounded on euery ſide by God, is by conſequence a diuine or Theologicall vertue.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe loue which we practiſe in hope aymes at GOD indeede THEO: marry it redounds vpon our ſelues, his aſpect is vpon the diuine goodneſſe, yet with a reſpect to our owne profit; it tends to this ſupreame perfection, but it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends our owne ſatisfaction; that is, it carrieth vs not towards God, for that he is ſoueraignely good in himſelfe, but becauſe he is ſoueraignely good to vs; in which, as you ſee, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2765:98"/> reſpect to our ſelues, and our proper intereſt; ſo that this loue is truely loue, but loue of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and profit; Yet doe I not affirme, that it doth in ſuch ſort returne to our ſelues, that it makes vs loue God onely for the loue of our ſelues; ô God no: For the ſoule which should not loue God, but for the loue of her ſelfe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the end of the loue which she beareth to God in her proper intereſt, should alas, commit an extreame ſacrilege. If a wife loue her husband onely for the loue of her ſeruant, she should loue her husband in nature of a ſeruant, and her ſeruant in the nature of a husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; ſo the ſoule that loueth not God, but for her ſelfe, loueth her ſelfe as she ought to loue God, and God as she ought to loue her ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there is a faire difference betwixt this word. I loue God for the good which I expect fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him; and this, I doe not loue God but in regard of the good which I expect from him; as it is alſo a farre other thing, to ſaie, I loue God for my ſelfe, and I loue God for the loue of my ſelfe, for when I ſay I loue God for my ſelfe, it is as though I should ſaie I loue to haue God, I loue that God should be myne, my ſoueraigne good, which is a holy affection of the heauenly Spouſe, who an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times in exceſſe of delight proteſteth; my well-beloued is wholy mine, and I entirely his, I to him, and he to me: but to ſaie I loue God, for loue of my ſelfe? is as one should ſaie, the loue which I beare to my ſelfe is the end why I loue God; in ſuch ſort, that the loue of God would be dependant, ſubordinate and inferiour to the loue
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2765:98"/> of our ſelues, which is a matchleſſe impietie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This loue then, which we terme hope, is a loue of concupiſcence, but of a holy, and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered concupiſcence, by meanes where of we doe not draw God to vs, nor to our profit, but we adioyne our ſelues vnto him as to our finall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; by this loue we loue our ſelues together with God, yet not preferring or equaliſing our ſelues to him in this loue; the loue of our ſelues is mixed with that of God, but that of God keepes the vpper had; our owne loue enters there, indeede but as a ſimple motife, not as principall end; our owne intereſt hath ſome place there, but God holds the principall rancke. Yea without doubt THEO: for when we loue God as our ſoueraigne, we loue him for a qualitie, by which we doe not referre him to vs, but vs to him. We are not his end, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or perfection, but he ours; he doth not appertaine to vs, but we to him; he depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not of vs, but we of him. In ſomme, by the qualitie of ſoueraigne good for which we loue him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth nothing of vs, but we receiue of him. He doth exerciſe vpon vs his plentie and bountie; and we our ſcarcitie and want; So that to loue God in qualitie of ſoueraigne good, is to loue him with an honorable and reſpectfull loue, by which we acknowledge him to be our perfection, repoſe and end, in the fruition of which our felicitie is placed: ſome things there are which are ſeruiceable vnto vs in their vſe, as our ſlaues, ſeruants, horſes, clothes, and the loue which we beare vnto them is a loue of pure concupiſcence, ſith we loue them not, but for our owne profit
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2765:99"/> onely. Other things there are wherof we haue the fruition, but a fruition which is reciprocall, and mutually equall, as we enioye our friends: for the loue we haue vnto them, in that they doe content vs, is indeede a loue of concupiſcence, yet an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt one, making them ours, and vs mutually theirs: them belonge to vs, and vs againe to them. But there are yet other things which we enioye by a fruition of dependance, participation, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection; as we doe the beneuolence, preſence or fauour of our Prelats, Princes, fathers, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for verily the loue which we beare vnto them, is truely a loue of concupiſcence; when we loue them in that they are our Princes, Prelats, Fathers, or mothers, ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is not the qualitie of a Prelate, Prince, Father or mother, which is the cauſe of our affection towards them, but becauſe they are ſuch to vs, and to our reſpects. But this concupiſcence is a loue of reſpect, reuerence and honour: we loue our Father, for example, not becauſe he is ours, but becauſe we are his: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it is that we loue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aſpire to God by hope, not to the end he might become our good, but for that he is our God already; not to th'end he should be ours, but becauſe we are his; not as though he were for vs, but in reſpect that we are for him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And note, THEO: that in this loue, the reaſon why we loue; that is, the reaſon why we applie our heart to the loue of the good which we deſire, is, becauſe it is our Good: but the reaſon of the meaſure and quantitie of this loue, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the excellencie and dignitie of the good
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2765:99"/> which we loue. We loue our benefactours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuch to vs, yet we loue them more o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. But whe I ſaie we loue God ſoueraignely, I doe not therefore ſaie, that we loue him with a ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne loue; ſoueraigne loue is onely in charitie; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas in hope loue is imperfect, becauſe it doth not tend to the ſoueraigne Bountie as being ſuch in it ſelfe, but onely for that it is ſuch to vs: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this kind of loue, there is no more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motife, then that which proceedes from the conſideration of the ſoueraigne good, we are ſaied by that, to loue ſoueraignly, though in very deede, none is able by vertue of this loue, ether to keepe Gods commandements, or obtaine life euerlaſting, beeing a loue that yeeldes more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then effect, when it is not accompanied with charitie.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO ſpeake generally, penance is a kinde of repentance, wherby a man doth reiect and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2765:100"/> deteſt the ſinne he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, with reſolution to repaire, as much as in him lyeth, the offence and iniurie done againſt the offended. I comprehend in penance a purpoſe to repaire the offence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that repentance doth not ſufficiently deteſt the fault, which voluntarily permitteth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall effect therof, to wit, the offence and iniurie to ſubſiſt; and it doth permit it to ſubſiſt, while it can in ſome ſort make reparation, and will not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I will omitt the penance of diuerſe pagans, who, as TERTVLLIAN doth witneſſe; had ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences of it amongſt them, but ſo vaine and frutleſſe, that they did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for hauing done well: and ſpeake onely of a vertuous penance, which according to the different motifes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it proceed's, is of a diuerſe ſpecies. There is one ſort purely morall and humane, as was that of ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER the Great, who hauing ſlaine his deare CLITVS thought to haue ſtarued himſelfe, ſo great was the force of penance, ſaieth CICERO: and that of ALCIBIADES, who being by SOCRATES conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not to be wiſe began to weepe bitterly, being ſorrowfull and afflicted, not to be that which he ought to haue bene, as SAINT AVGVSTINE ſaieth. ARISTOTLE alſo acknowledging this ſort of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, aſſures vs, that the intemperate man, who on ſet purpoſe giues himſelf ouer to pleaſures, is wholy incorrigible, for that he cannot repent, and he that is impenitent is incurable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Certes SENECA, PLVTARKE, and the PY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAGORIANS, who ſo highly commended the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of conſcience, but eſpecially the firſt, who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2765:100"/> ſpeaketh ſo feelingly of the torment, which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour remorce doth excite in the ſoule, without doubt vnderſtood, that there was a repentance; and as for the wiſe E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ICTETES, he doth ſo well deſcribe the reprehention, which a man is to vſe towards himſelf, that ſcarcely is any thing to be added.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is yet an other penance, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede morall yet religious too, yea in ſome ſort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, proceeding from the naturall knowledge which we haue of our offending GOD by ſinne: For certainly many Philoſophers vnderſtood, that to liue vertuouſly was a thing agreeable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodneſſe, and conſequently, to liue vitiouſly was offenſiue vnto him. The good EPICTETES, wished that he might dye a Chriſtian (as it is very probable he did,) and amongſt other things, he ſaied he should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, if dying he could lift vp his hands to God and ſaie vnto him; For my part, I haue not dishonored thee. Furthermore, he will haue his Philoſopher to make an admirable Oth to God, neuer to be diſobedient to his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, nor to accuſe or blame any thing coming from him, nor yet in any ſort to complaine therof: And in another place he teacheth that GOD and our good Angell, are preſent to all our actions. You ſee then THEO: that this Philoſopher, as yet Pagan, knew that ſinne offended GOD, as vertue honored him, and conſequently, he thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance neceſſarie, ſith that euen he ordained an examen of conſcience at night, in reſpect wherof with Pithagoras he gaue this aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<q>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:2765:101"/>
                     <l>Let conſcience of the fact be vertues meede,</l>
                     <l>Let bitter reprehenſion vice ſucceede.</l>
                  </q> Now this kind of repentance tyed to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and loue of GOD which nature can giue, was a dependance of morall religion: but as naturall reaſon beſtowed more knowledge then loue vpon the Philoſophers, who glorified him not with proportion to the notice, they had therof; ſo did nature furnish them with more light to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how much God was offended by ſinne, then heate to ſtire vp repentance, neceſſarie for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the offence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And abbeit religious penance hath in ſome ſort bene acknowledged by ſome of the Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, yet ſo rarely and weakly, that thoſe which were reputed the moſt vertuous amongſt them, to wit the STOIKES, gaue aſſurance, that the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was neuer attriſtated, wherevpon they framed a MAXIME, ſo contrarie to reaſon, as the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which it was grounded, was contrarie to experience, THAT THE WISE-MAN SINNED NOT.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may therefore well ſaie THEO: that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is a vertue wholy Chriſtian, ſith on the one ſide it was ſo little knowen to the Pagans, and on the other ſide, it is ſo well knowen amongſt true Chriſtians, that in it conſiſteth a great part of the Euangelicall Philoſophie, according to which, who ſoeuer affirmeth that he sinneth not, is mad and who ſoeuer thinketh without penance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe his ſinne is frantike for it is our Sauiours exhortation of exortations, DOE PENANCE Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2765:101"/> a briefe deſcription of the progreſſe of this vertue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We enter into a deepe apprehenſion, why we offend GOD ſo farre as we are able, in deſpiſing, dishonoring, diſobeying and rebelling againſt him; who againe, of his part, holdeth himſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended theraat, irritated, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d contemned, diſtaſting, reprouing and abhorring iniquitie. Out of this true apprehenſion, diuers motiues ſpring, which either all, or many together, or each one a part, may carrie vs to this repentance: For it enters into our thoughts ſome times, that GOD the offended hath eſtablished a rigourous punishment in Hell for ſinners, and that he will depriue them of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice prepared for the good. And as the deſire of Paradice is extreamly honorable; ſo the feare to looſe it, is greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderable, and not that onely, but the deſire of Paradice, being of high eſteeme, the feare of its contrarie, hell, is good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. O who would not dread ſo great a loſſe, ſo great a torment? And this double feare, the one ſeruile the other mercenarie, doth greatly beare vs forwards, towards a repentance for our ſinnes, by which we haue incurred them. And to this effect in the holy word, this feare is a thouſand and a thouſand times intimated. Againe we conſider the deformitie and malice of ſinne according as faith doth teach vs, as for example, that by yet, the lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Image of GOD is defiled and diſuigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the dignitie of our ſoule dishonoured; that we are become like brute beaſts, that we haue violated our dutie towards the CREATOR of the world, forfetted the happineſſe of the Angelicall
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2765:102"/> ſocietie, to aſſociate, and ſubiect our ſelues to the Diuell, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the ſlauerie of our owne paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the order of reaſon, offending our GOOD-ANGELS, to whom we haue ſo great obligation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. At other times we are prouoked to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by the beautie of vertue, which brings as much good with it, as ſinne doth euill. Further we are often moued to it, by the example of Saints: for who did euer caſt his eies vpon the exerciſes of the incomparable penance of a MAGDELAINE, of a MARIE EGIPTIACA; or of the PENITENTS of the Monaſterie ſurnamed PRISON, deſcribed by S. IOHN CLIMACVS without being moued to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for his ſinns: ſithence the very reading of the Hiſtorie doth incite therto ſuch, as are not altogether inſenſible.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw all theſe motiues are taught vs by faith, and Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore the repentance which thence iſſueth is very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though otherwiſe imperfect; very laudable certainly it is: for neither the holy Scripture, nor Church would euer haue vſed theſe motifes to haue ſtirred vs vp, if the penance thence proceeding had not bene good; and we ſee manifeſtly, that it is moſt agreeable to reaſon, to repent for ſinne, for theſe conſiderations; yea that it is impoſsible, that he who conſidereth them attentiuely, should not repent. Yet it is an imperfect repentance, becauſe the diuine loue is not as yet found there: ah! doe

               <p n="2">2. And note, that I doe not ſaie that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances reiect the loue of God, but onely that they doe not include it; they doe not repulſe it, yet doe they not containe it; they are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to it, but as yet are without it; it is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor yet is it included. The will which doth ſim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply imbrace good, is good, yet if she ſo imbrace it as to reiect the better, she is truly diſordinate, not in accepting the one, but in repulſing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So to vow to giue almes this day is good, yet to vow, to giue onely this day, were bad; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would exclude the better, that is to giue both to day, to morrow, and euery day when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thus the famous PENITENT-LOVER loued firſt her Sauiour; that loue was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into teares, and thoſe into an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue: whence our Sauiour told her that many ſinns were pardon'd her becauſe she loued much.

Penance is indeed a water in it's ſubſtance being a true diſlike a reall griefe and repentance, yet is it hot for that it containes the propertie of Loue, whence it ſprings, and giues the life of Grace.

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:2765:104"/>5. Yet will I not affirme that the perfect loue of God by which we loue him aboue all things, doth alwayes preceede this repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor that this repentance doth alwayes preceede this loue: for though it doth happen ſo many tymes, yet ſo, as that otherwhiles alſo, at the ſame inſtant that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue is conceiued in our heart, penance is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by loue; and often times penance entring into our heart, loue doth enter with it; and as when ESAV came out of his mothers wombe, IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB his twinne-brother, held him by the foote, to the end that their births might not onely follow the one the other, but alſo might hold and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle one an other; ſo repentance, rude and rough in regard of it's ſorrowe, was firſt borne, as another ESAV, and loue ſweete and gracious, holds him by the foote and doth cleeue ſo vnto him, that their birth was one, ſith the end of the birth of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was the beginning of that of perfect loue. Now as ESAV did firſt appeare, ſo repentance doth ordinarily make it ſelfe to be ſeene before loue, but loue as another IACOB, although the younger, doth afterwards ſubdue penance, conuerting it into conſolation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Marke I praie you THEO: the well-beloued MAGDELEINE, how she weepes with loue; they haue taken vp my Sauiour, quoth she melting into teares, and I know not where they haue put him: but hauing by teares and ſobbs found him, she holds and poſſeſſeth him by loue. Imperfect loue deſires and requires him, penance doth ſeeke and find him, perfect loue doth hold and tye him. Euen as it is ſaied of the Ethiopian Rubies whoſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2765:104"/> fire is naturally very blew, but being dipped in vineger, it shins and caſteth out its cleare raies: for the loue which goeth before repentance, is ordinarily imperfect; but being ſteeped in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of penace, it gaines ſtrengh, and becomes excellent loue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Yea it happens ſome times that penance, though imperfect, containes not in it ſelfe the proper action of loue, but onely the vertue and proprietie of it: you will aske me, what vertue or proprietie of loue can repentance haue, if she haue not the action: GOD's goodneſſe is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife of perfect repentance, whom it diſpleaſeth vs to haue offended: now this motife is for no other reaſon a motife, then that it doth ſtire, and moue vs. But the motion which the diuine goodneſſe giues vnto the heart which conſiders, it, can be no other then the motion of loue, that is of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And therefore true repentance, though it ſeeme not ſo, and though we perceiue not the proper effect of loue, receiues alwayes motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from loue, and the vnitiue nature therof by meanes of which she doth reunite and reioyne vs to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodneſſe. Tell me I praie, is it the propertie of the ADAMANT to draw, and ioine iron vnto it ſelfe? Doe we not ſee that iron touched with the ADAMANT, without either it, or its nature, but onely its vertue, and attractiue power, doth notwithſtanding draw and vnite vnto it an other iron? So perfect repentance touched with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife of loue, without hauing the proper action of loue, leaues not to haue the vertue and qualitie therof, that is an vniting motion, to reioyne and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2765:105"/> reunite our hearts to the diuine will: But you will replie, what difference is there betwixt this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting motion of penance, and the proper action of loue. THEO: the action of loue is indeede a motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnion, but it is performed by complacence, wheras the motion of vnion which is in penance, is not done by way of complacence, but by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, repentance, reparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reconciliation; for ſo much therefore, as this motion doth vnite, it is indued with the qualitie of loue; in ſo much as it is bitter, and dolorous, it receiues the qualitie of penance, and in fine, by its naturall condition it is a true motion of penance; yet ſo, as it retaines the vertue and vniting qualitie of loue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So Treacle-wine is not ſo named for that it doth containe the proper Subſtance of Treacle, for there is none at all there, but it is ſo called, becauſe the plant of the vine hauing bene ſteeped in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the grapes and vines which ſprung from it, drew into them ſelues, the vertue and operation of the Treacle, againſt all ſorts of poiſon; we muſt not therefore thinke it ſtrang, if penance accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the holy ſcripture, doe blot-out ſinne, ſaue the ſoule, make her gratefull to GOD, and iuſtifie her, which are effects appertaining to loue, and ſeeme not to be attributed to any ſaue it: for though loue it ſelfe be not alwaies found in perfect penance; yet its vertue and proprieties are alwaies there, conueied thither by the motife of loue whence it ſprung.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nor muſt we admire that the force of loue should ſpring out of penance, before loue be there formed ſith we ſee that the reflection of the ſunne
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2765:105"/> beames beating vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a looking glaſſe, heate, which is the vertue and proper qualitie of fire, gaines by little and little ſo much force, that it begins to burne, before it haue yet well produced the fire, or at leaſt before we perceiued it; for ſo the holy ghoſt caſting into our vnderſtanding the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the greatneſſe of our ſinns, for that by them we haue offended ſo ſoueraigne a Bountie, and our will receiuing the reflection of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, repentance by little and little groweth ſo ſtrong, with a certaine affectiue heate and deſire to returne into grace with God, that in fine this motion becomes ſo compleate, that it doth burne and vnite, euen before the loue be fully formed, which notwithſtanding as a ſacred fire is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly in that moment kindled: ſo that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance neuer comes to the point of burning and reuniting the heart to God, which is her vtmoſt perfection, but she find's her ſelfe wholy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into fire, and flames of loue, the end of the one giuing the other a beginning, yea rather the end of penance is within the beginning of loue, as ESAV his foote, was within Iacobs hand, in ſuch ſort, that as ſoone as ESAV ended his birth, Iacob begun his; the end of the ones birth, being ioyned, tyed, and which is more, enuironed with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the others for ſo the beginning of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue, doth not onely follow the end of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but doth euen cleaue, and tye it ſelfe to it; and to containe all in one word, this beginning of loue, doth mixe it ſelfe with the end of repentance and in this motion of mixture, pennance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition merits life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:2765:106"/>3. Now becauſe this louing repentance is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily practiſed by eleuations and raiſings vp of the heart to God, like to thoſe of the auncient pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents: I am thine ô Lord, ſaue me, haue mercy vpon me, for in thee my ſoule doth confide; ſaue me o Lord, for the waters doe ouerwhelme my ſoule. Vſe me like one of thy hirelings. Lord be propitious, to me a poore ſinner. It is not without reaſon that ſome haue ſaied, that Praier did iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: for the repentant Praier, or the ſuppliant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, raiſing vp the ſoule to God, and reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to his goodneſſe without doubt obtaines Pardon, in vertue of holy loue, which giues the ſacred motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therefore we ought to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with ſuch iaculatorie praiers, made in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of louing repentance, and deſire aiming at our reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, to th'end that by the meanes therof laying before our Sauiour our tribulation, we may poure out our ſoules, before, and with in his pitifull heart, who will receiue them to mercy.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

If any one should ſaie that mans freewill, being moued and incited by GOD doth cooperate in nothing, by conſenting to GOD who did moue and call him, to the end he might diſpoſe and prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to obtaine the grace of Iuſtification, and that he could not conſent though he would, verily he should be excommunicated, and reproued by the Church.

He is choſen ſaieth the ſacred ſpouſe from amongſt a thouſand, she ſaieth from amongſt a thouſand, but she would ſaie from amongſt all, whence this loue is not a loue of ſimple excellencie, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable loue: for charitie loues God by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eſteeme and preferance ſo high and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other eſteemes, that other loues either are not true loues, in compariſon of this or if they be true loues this loue is infinitly more then loue, and therefore THEO: it is not a loue which the force of nature either angelicall or humane can produce, but the holy Ghoſt doth giue it and poure it into our hearts; and as our ſoules which animate the bodie, haue not their origine from the bodie, but are there put by the naturall prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God; ſo Charitie, which giues life to our hearts, hath not her extraction from thence, but is poured into them as an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly liquour, by the ſupernaturall prouidence, of his diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For this reaſon, and for that it hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, and doth tend vnto him, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the naturall knowledge we haue of his goodneſſe, but according to the ſupernaturall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2765:109"/> knowledge of faith; we name it ſupernaturall frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shipe. Whence she together with faith, and hope, keepes reſidence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as a Maieſticall Queene, is ſeated in the will, as in her Throne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce she conueies into the ſoule her dainties, and ſweetes, making her therby faire, agreeable, and amiable to the diuine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that if the ſoule be a kingdome wherof the Holy Ghoſt is the king, Charitie is the Queene ſet at his right hand in a Robe of gold wrought in varietie. If the ſoule be a Queene, Spouſe to the great king of heauen; Charitie is her Crowne which doth roially adorne her heade: yea if the ſoule with the bodie be a little world, Charitie is the Sunne which beautifies all, heates all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiues all,</p>

Feare not but thou maieſt be iuſtified euen vntill death: the path of the iuſt is aduanced, and

All theſe are ſacred wordes out of DAVID, S. IOHN, ECCLESIASTES, and S. PAVLE.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I neuer heard of any liuing creature whoſe grouth was not bounded and limited, ſaue onely the Crocodile who from an extreamly lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beginning neuer ceaſeth to growe till she come to her end, repreſenting equally in this the good, and the wicked; for the arrogance of ſuch as hate God, ſwells continually ſaieth the great kind DAVID; and the good doe encreaſe as the breake of the day, from brightneſſe to brightneſſe: and to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d long at a ſtaie in one eſtate is a thing impoſſible; he that gaines not, looſeth in this traficke; he that aſcends not, deſcends vpon this ladder; he that vanquisheth not in this battell, is vanquished: we liue amidſt the dangers of the warrs which our enemie doth wage with vs; if we reſiſt not, we perish; and we cannot reſiſt, but we ouercome, nor ouercome without triumphe: for, as ſaieth the glorious S. BERNARD; it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in particular of man, that he neuer remaines in one ſtate; he doth neceſſarily either goe forward or returne backward. Euery one runns, but one onely beares away the prize, runne ſo, as you may obtaine it. Who is the prize, but IESVS-CHRIST? And how can you attaine him, if you follow him not? But if you follow him, you shall march, and runne continually: for he neuer makes ſtaie, but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2765:111"/> continues his courſe of loue and obedience euen vntill death, and death of the croſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Goe then, ſaith S. BERNARD, goe I ſaie with him, goe my deare THEO: and admit no other bounds, then thoſe of life, and as long as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, runne after this Sauiour; but runne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and louingly: for what better will you be to follow him if you be not ſo happie as to ouerta him? Let vs heare the Prophete; I haue inclined my heart to doe thy Iuſtifications eternally, he doth not ſaie, that he will doe them for a time onely, but euerlaſtingly; and becauſe he deſires e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally to doe well, he shall haue an eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Bleſſed are they, who are pure in the way, who walke in the law of our Lord: accurſed are they who are defiled, who walke not in the law of our Lord: It is onely a ſaying of the Diuell, that he will ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Norh. Vnworthy man wilt thou ſit downe? ah! knoweſt thou not that thou art vpon the way, and that the way is not made to ſit downe but to goe in? and ſo to goe in, that to goe, is to paſſe on the way. And God ſpeaking to one of his greateſt friends: walke ſaieth he before me and be perfect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. True vertue hath no limits she findes ſtill PLVS VLTRA; but eſpecially holy Charitie, which is the vertue of vert es, and hauing an infinite obiect, might be capable to become infinite, if she could meete with a heart capable of infinitie; nothing hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this loue to be infinite ſaue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the will which receiues it, and is to become actiue by it; which, as it is cauſe that neuer any shall ſee God, as much as he is viſible, ſo neuer any shall be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2765:111"/> able to loue him, as much as he is amiable. The heart which could loue GOD with a loue equall to the diuine Goodneſſe, should haue a will infinitly good, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be but in God. Charitie then in vs may be perfected eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to infinitie, but excluſiuely, that is, Charitie may become more and more and ſtill more excellent, yet neuer infinite. The Holy Ghoſt, may eleuate our hearts, and apply them to what ſupernaturall actions it shall pleaſe him, ſo they be not infinite; for betwixt little an great things, though the one exceede the other neuer ſo much, there is ſtill ſome proportion, prouided alwaies, that the exceſſe of the thing which doth exceede be not infinite: but betweene finite and infinite there is no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor can there be any made, vnleſſe either the finite thing be raiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, or the infinite brought downe to finitie, which is impoſsible.</p>

So that euen the Charitie which is in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemour, as he is man, though greater then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell or man can comprehend, yet is it not infinite of it ſelfe, and in its owne being, but onely in the eſtimation of the dignitie and merite therof, as being the charitie of a diuine Perſon who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="1">1. DOe you ſee. THEO. this glaſſe of water, or this peece of bread which a holy ſoule giues to a poore bodie for Gods ſake, it is a ſmale matter God-wot, and in humane conceipt hardly worthy of conſideration: God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth recompence it, and forthwith for it doth giue ſome encreaſe of Charitie: the Gotes haire which aunciently was preſented to the TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERNACLE, was taken in good part, and had place amongſt the holy Offerings; and the little actions which proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charitie are agreeable to God and meritorious: for as in the happie ARABIA, not onely the plants which are by nature odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but euen all the others are ſweete, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the felicitie of that ſoyle; ſo in a charitable be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, not onely the workes which are excellent in their owne nature, but euen euery little action doth relish the vertue of holy loue, and hath a good odour before the maieſtie of God, who in conſideration thereof doth augment charitie. And I ſaie God doth it, becauſe Charitie doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her owne encreaſe as doth a tree, who by her owne vertue doth thruſt and branch out her boughes; but as Faith, Hope and Charitie are vertues which haue their origine from the diuine
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2765:112"/> goodneſſe; ſo thence alſo they draw their encreaſe and perfection; not vnlike vnto Bees, who hauing their extraction from honie, haue alſo their foode from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore like as Pearls are not onely bred of dew, but fed alſo with it, the Mother-pearls to this end opening their shels towards Heauen to begge, in a manner, the droppes which the fresh aire makes fall at the breake of the day; ſo we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued Faith, Hope, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Charitie of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Bountie, we ought alwaies to turne and bend our hearts thitherwards, thence to obtaine the continuation and augmentation of the ſame vertues. O Lord, doth the holy Church our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach vs to ſaie, giue vs the encreaſe of faith, hope, and charitie; And it is done in imitation of thoſe that ſaied to our Sauiour, Lord encreaſe faith in vs, and following the counſell of S. PAVLE who aſſures vs, that God onely is able to make all grace abound in vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is God therefore that giues this encreaſe in conſideration of the imploime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which we make of his grace, as it is written; to him who hath, (that is, who doth imploy the fauours receiued) more shall be giuen, and he shall abound. Thus is our Sauiours exhortation practiſed; Heape vp trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurs in heauen: as though he should ſaie, to your precedent good workes, adde ſtill new ones: for Faſting, and Almes deedes are the peeces wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of your treaſurs are to conſiſts. Now, as amongſt the treaſurs of the Temple, the poore widdowes mite was much eſteemed, and as indeede, by the addition of many little peeces the treaſurs waxe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2765:113"/> great and a greater value is ſet vpon them; ſo the leaſt of little good workes, though performed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſomewhat coldly, and not according to the whole latitude of the Charitie which is in vs, is agreeable to God, and eſteemed by him; In ſuch ſort, that though of themſelues they cannot cauſe any encreaſe in the precedent loue, being of leſſe force then it; yet the Diuine Prouidence, waighing, and out of his goodneſſe highly priſing them, doth forthwith reward them with encreaſe of Charitie for the preſent, and for the time to come, with a more ample glorie in heauen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEOT: the delicious honie is the Bee's Maiſter-peece; nor yet is their waxe therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, but is an honour to their labours: Louing hearts ought to endeuour, to bring forth workes full of feruour, and of high value, to the end they might puiſſantly augment Charitie: yet if they bring forth ſome of leſſer value, they shall not looſe their recompence; for God will take them in good part, that is to ſaie, he will therby loue them a little more. Nor doth God euer loue a ſoule that is in Charitie more, without beſtowing alſo vpon her more Charitie, our loue towards him being the proper, and ſpeciall effect of his loue towards vs,</p>
               <p n="5">5. By how much more liuely we looke vpon our picture in a looking glaſſe, by ſo much more attentiuely it lookes vpon vs againe; and by how much more louingly God doth caſt his gracious eies vpon our ſoule, which is made to his Image and likneſſe, our ſoule mutually, with ſo much more attention and feruour is fixed vpon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2765:113"/> Goodneſſe, anſwering, according to her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, all the encreaſe of Diuine Loue which this ſoueraigne ſweeteneſſe work's in her. The Councell of Trent ſaieth thus: If any ſaie that iuſtice receiued, is not conſerued, yea that it is not augmented by good workes in the ſight of God, but that workes are onely the fruites and ſignes of iuſtification acquired, and not the cauſe of its encreaſe, let him be accurſed. Doe you marke THEO: how iuſtification wrought by Charitie, is augmented by good works, and which is to be noted, by good works without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for as S. Bernard ſaieth excellently well vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage; nothing is excepted, or nothing is diſtinguished; the Councell ſpeakes of good workes indiſtinctly and without reſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to vnderſtand, that not onely the great and feruent, but alſo the little and faint workes doe cauſe the encreaſe of Charitie: but the great ones in a greater manner, the little ones, in a leſſer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such is the loue which God beares to our ſoules, ſuch his deſire to make vs encreaſe in the loue which we owe to him. The Diuine ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe renders all things profitable vnto vs; takes all to our aduantage, and turnes all our endeuours, though neuer ſo faint and of low condition, to our gaine.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the commerce of morall vertues little works bring no encreaſe to the vertue whence they proceede, but contrariwiſe, if they be very little, doe impaire it: for a great Liberalitie doth perish, while she is buſied in beſtowing things of ſmale value, and of liberalitie becomes niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2765:114"/> But in the traficke of vertues which iſſue from God's mercy, and eſpecially from Charitie, euery worke returnes profit: Nor is it ſtrang that ſacred Loue, as king of vertues, hath nothing either great or ſmale, which is not amiable, ſith the Baulme tree, prince of ſweete trees, beares neither barke nor leafe, that is not odoriferous: and what could loue bring fourth that were not worthie of loue, or did not tend to loue?</p>

A great and braue King hauing eſpouſed a moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable young Princeſſe, and hauing on a certaine day led her into his ſecret Cloſet, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with her more at his pleaſure; after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he ſaw her by a certaine ſudden accident fall downe as dead at his foote. Alas! he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely aſtonished at this, and it did well nigh put him alſo into a ſownd; for she was dearer to him then his owne life. Yet the ſame Loue that gaue him this aſſault of griefe, did fourthwith giue him ſtrength to ſuſtaine it, and put him into action, to th'end that with an incomparable prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude he might remedie the euill of the deare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2765:114"/> Companion of his life: ſo that with a nimble ſpeede opening a Dreſſer which ſtood by, he takes a cordiall water infinitly precious, and hauing fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his mouth with it, by force he ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the cloſed lippes and teeth of his well-beloued Princeſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breathing, and ſpurting the precious liquor which he held in his mouth, into his poore Loues, who lay in a ſownd; and poureing the reſt of the glaſſe vpon her noſe, her temples, and about her heart, he made her returne to her ſelfe and ſenſes againe; that done, he helpes her vp ſoftely, and by vertue of remedies, doth ſo ſtrengthen and bring her to life, that she begins to ſtand, and walke fairely with him; but in no ſort without his helpe for he goes aſsiſting and ſuſtaining her vnder the arme, till at length he laied to her heart an Epetheme ſo precious, and of ſo great vertue, that finding her ſelfe entirely reſtored to her wounted health, she walkes all alone, her deare Spouſe not now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiening her ſo much, but onely holding her right hand ſoftly betwixt his, and his right arme folded vnder hers, and vnder her breaſts. Thus he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with all did her foure good offices: for 1. he gaue teſtimonie that his heart was louin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly carefull of her. 2. he neuer deſiſted to ſolace her. 3. if she felt any touch of her former faintneſſe returne, he would ſuſtaine her. 4. if she light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any rough and difficile way, he would be her ſupport and ſtaie; And in Aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she would make a little more haſt, he would lift her vp, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully ſuccour her. In fine he ſtaied by her with a cordiall regard till night approached, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo he would aſsiſt in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueying her, to her royall bed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:2765:115"/>2. The iuſt ſoule is the Spouſe of our Sauiour, and becauſe she is neuer iuſt, but when she is in charitie, she is alſo neuer ſpouſe but she is led into the ſacred Cloſet, of thoſe delicious perfumes, mentioned in the Canticles; Now, when the ſoule thus honored, commits ſinne, she falls as dead of a ſpirituall faintneſſe; and this is truely an vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident: for who would euer haue thought that a Creature would haue forſaken her Creator and ſoueraigne Good, for things ſo ſlight as the baites of ſinne? Certes the Heauens are aſtonished at it, and if God were ſubiect to paſsions, he would fall downe in a ſownd at this mishappe, as when he was mottall he died vpon the croſſe for our Redemption. But ſeeing it is not now neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that he should imploy his loue to dye for vs, when he ſeeth the ſoule ouerthrowne by ſinne, he commonly runs to her ſuccour, and by an vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy, laies open the gates of her heart, by the ſtings and remorses of conſcience, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the diuers lightes and apprehenſions which he caſt's into our hearts, with healthfull motions, by which as by an odoriferous and vitall water he makes the ſoule returne home to her ſelfe, and ſenſes. And all this THEO: God works in vs without our helpe, his amiable Bountie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting vs with his ſweeteneſſe. For euen as our languishing Bride had remained dead in her ſownd, if the king had not aſsiſted; ſo the ſoule would remaine loſt in her ſinne if God preuented her not. But if the ſoule thus excitated, adde her conſent to the feeling of Grace, ſeconding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration which preuented her, and receiuing the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2765:115"/> aides and remedies requiſite, prouided for her by God; he will fortifie her and conduct her through the diuers motions of Faith, Hope, and Penance, euen till he reſtore her to her true ſpirituall health which is Charitie. Now in her paſſage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue to vertue, by which he diſpoſeth her to Loue, he doth not conduct her onely, but in ſuch ſort ſuſtaine her, that as she of her ſide walkes what she is able, ſo he of his part ſupports and ſuſtaines her, and it is hard to ſaie, whether she goes, or she is carried: for she is not ſo carried that she goes not, and yet she goes ſo, that if she were not carried, she could not goe at all. So that to ſpeake Apoſtolically, she muſt ſaie; I goe, not I alone, but the Grace of God with me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Soule being entirely reſtored to her health, by the excellent Epitheme of Charitie which the Holy Ghoſt infuſeth into her heart, she is then able to goe, and keepe her ſelfe vpon her feete of her ſelfe, yet by vertue of this health, and this ſacred Epitheme of holy Loue. Wherefore though she be able to goe of her ſelfe, yet is she to rende the glorie thereof to God, who beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon her a health ſo vigourous, and manlie: for whether the Holy Ghoſt doth fortifie vs by the motions which he doth imprint in our hearts, or he doth ſuſtaine vs by the Charitie which he doth infuſe into it; whether he doth ſuccour vs by manner of aſſiſtance, in lightening and carrying vs; or that he doth ſtrengthen our hearts by poureing into them fortifying and quickening Loue; We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes liue, goe, and operate, in and by him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And although by meanes of Charitie poured
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2765:116"/> into our Soules, we are able to walke in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and make aduancement in the way of Saluation, yet ſo, as that the Goodneſſe of God doth ſtill aſſiſt the ſoule whom he hath daigned with his Loue, continually holding her with his holy hand: For ſo 1. he doth better make appeare the ſweeteneſſe of his loue towards her. 2. he goes ſtill more and more encouraging her. 3. he giues her comfort againſt depraued inclinations, and euill cuſtomes contracted by her former ſinne. 4. and finally, he maintains and defends her from temptations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Doe not we often ſee THEO: that ſound and luſtie men muſt be prouoked to employ their ſtrength and power well, and as one would ſaie muſt be drawen by the hand to the worke? So God hauing endewed vs with Charitie, and in it, with force and ſufficiencie to gaine ground in the way of perfection; his Loue doth not permit him to let vs march all alone, but makes him put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon the way with vs, it vrgeth him to vrge vs, and doth ſollicite his heart, to ſollicite and driue forwards ours to make good vſe of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which he gaue vs, repeating often by meanes of his inſpirations, S. PAVLES Aduertiſements: See that thou receiue not heauenly Grace in vaine, while you haue time; doe all the good you can; runne ſo as you may winne the goale. So that we are often to thinke, that he iterats in our eares, the words which he vſed to the good Father ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM: walke before me and be perfect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But principally the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of God is requiſite for the ſoule endewed with Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2765:116"/> in her enterpriſes which are ſublime and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie: for be it that Charitie, though very weake, doth ſufficiently incline vs, and vnleſſe I be deceiued, afford force inough to performe the workes neceſſarie to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. yet ſo, that to aſpire to, and vndertake excellent and extraordinarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, our hearts ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in neede of putting on, and heateing, by the hand and motion of this great heauenly Louer; as the Princeſſe in our Parable, although reſtored to health, could not aſcend, nor haue gone faſt, had not her deare Spouſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued and ſtrongely ſuſtained her. To this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, S. ANTONIE, and Simeon Stylite, were in the Grace of God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Charitie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did deſigne ſo high e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpriſes: as alſo the B. mother S.

               <p n="7">7. Doe you not marke the young man of the Ghoſpell, whom our Sauiour loued, and who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was in Charitie? certes he neuer dream'd of ſelling all he had, to giue it to the poore, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

In theſe great works THEO: onely inſpirations are not ſufficient, but further we muſt be fortified, to be able to effect that which the inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inclines vs to. As againe in the fierce aſſaultes of extraordinarie te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, the ſpeciall and particular preſence of heauenly ſuccours is altogether neceſſarie. For this cauſe, the holy Church makes vs ſo frequently crie out: Excite our hearts ô Lord, preuent our actions by breathing vpon vs; and in aiding vs, accompanie vs; O Lord be prompt to helpe vs, and the like; therby to obtaine grace to be able to effect excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and extraordinarie works, and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and feruently to exerciſe ordinarie ones: as alſo more ardently to reſiſt ſmale temptations, and more valliently to encounter great ones. S. ANTONIE was aſſailed by a hideous legion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, whoſe rage hauing a long time ſuſtained, not without incredible paine and torment; at length he eſpied the couer of his Cell deuided, and a heauenly raie enter the breach, which made the blacke and diſordered Route of his enemies vanish in a moment, and deliuered him of the paine of his wounds receiued in that ſchirmish, whence he perceiued God's particular preſence, and caſting out a grone towards the brightneſſe; where waſt thou ô good IESVS, quoth he, where waſt thou? why waſt thou not here from the beginning to haue remedied my paine? It was answered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, Antonie, I was here: but I expected the euent of thy combat: And ſithens thou behaued
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2765:117"/> thy ſelfe brauely and valiently, I will be thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall aide. But in what the valour, and courage of this braue ſpirituall Combatant did conſiſt, he himſelfe, another time declars, that being ſet vpon by a Diuell who profeſſed to be the Spirit of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this Glorious Sainte after many words worthy of his great courage, fell a ſinging the 7. verſe of the 115.

EVen as a tender mother, leading with her, her little babe, doth aſſiſt and ſupport him according as neede requires, letting him now and then aduenture a ſtep by himſelfe in plaine, or leſſe dangerous way, now taking him by the hand to weeld him, now taking him vp in her armes and bearing him: ſo our Sauiour hath a continuall care to conduct his children, that is ſuch as are in Charitie; making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> walke before him, reaching them his hand in difficulties, and bearing them himſelfe in ſuch paines, as he ſees otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he declared by ISAIE ſaying, I am thy GOD, taking thee by the hand, and ſaying feare not, I haue helped thee. So that with a ſtrong courage we muſt haue a firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, and his aſsiſtance: for if we faile
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2765:118"/> not to ſecond his Grace, he will accomplish in vs the happie worke of our Saluation, which he alſo began, working in vs both the VELLE and PERFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERE, as the Holy Councell of Trent doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this conduct which the heauenly ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe daignes to our ſoules, from their entry to Charitie, vntill their finall perfection, which is not finished but in the period of life, doth the great gift of Perſeuerance conſiſt to which our Sauiour annecteth the greater gift of eternall glorie, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that which he ſaieth, he that shall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the end, shall be ſaued: for this gift is no other thing then a ſetting together, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the diuers ſupports, ſolaces, and ſuccours wherby we continew in the Loue of God till death: as the education, breeding, and feeding of a child is no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the many cares, aides and ſuccours, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other offices befitting a child, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and continued towards him till he grow to yeares in which he shall not neede them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the continuance of ſuccours and helpes, are not equall in all thoſe that perſeuer: for in ſome it is short, as in ſuch as were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before their death: ſo it happened to the good Thiefe; ſo to the Sergeant, who ſeeing S. IAMES his conſtancie, made forthwith profeſſion of Faith and became a companion of the Matyrdome of this great Apoſtle: ſo to the glorious Porter who kept the 40. Martyrs in SEBASTE, who ſeeing one of them looſe courage, and forſake the crowne of Martyrdome did put himſelfe in his place, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce became Chriſtian, Martyr, and Glorious: ſo to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2765:119"/> the Notarie, of whom mention is made in S. AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONIE of Padua his life, who hauing all his life bene a falſe villaine, yet died a Martyr: And ſo it hapned to a thouſand others, whom we haue ſeene, and red that they died well, after an ill life. And as for theſe they ſtand not in neede of a great varietie of ſuccours, but vnleſſe ſome great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation croſſe their way, may performe this short perſeuerance by the onely Charitie giuen then, and by the aides by which they were conuerted. For they arriue at the PORT without ſailing, and finish their pilgrimage in one onely iumpe, which the puiſſant mercy of God made them take in ſo due time, that their enemies ſaw them triumphe, before they ſtroke: ſo that their conuerſion and perſeuerance were ſcarcely diſtinguished, and if one would be exact in the proprietie of words, the grace which they receiued of God, wherby they attained as ſoone the iſſue, as the entry of their pretentions, could not well be termed Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though otherwiſe holding in effect the place of perſeuerance, in that it giues ſaluation, we comprehend it vnder the name of Perſeuerance. Now in others Perſeuerance is longer, as in S. ANNE the Propheteſſe; in S. IOHN the Euangeliſt; S. PAVLE the firſt Hermite; S. HILARION; S. ROMWALD; S FRANCIS of Paula, and they ſtood in neede of a thouſand ſundrie kinds of aſsiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the varietie of the aduenturs of their Pilgrimage, and the sharpneſſe of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Howbeit Perſeuerance is a gift, the moſt to be deſired of any thing we can hope for in this life, and which, as he Councell of Trent ſaieth; we
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2765:119"/> cannot haue but from the hand of God, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can aſſure him that ſtand's, and helpe him vp that falls: Wherfore we muſt inceſſantly demand it, making vſe of the meanes which our Sauiour hath tought vs, to the obtaining of it, Praier, Faſting, Almes deedes, frequenting the Sacraments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with the good, the hearing and reading of pious leſſons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now ſithens the gift of Praier and deuotion is liberally granted to all, thar freely doe conſent to diuine inſpirations, it is conſequently in our power to perſeuer. Yet not ſo, that I would hence inferre, that Perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath her beginning from our power; for contrariwiſe I know she doth ſpring from God's mercy, whoſe moſt precious gift she is, but I would ſaie that though she doth not proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our power, yet comes she with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of it, by meanes of our will which we cannot denie to be in our power: for be it, that Gods grace is neceſſarie for vs, to will to perſeuer, yet is this will in our power, becauſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly grace is neuer manting to our will, while our will is not wanting to our power. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, according to the great S. BERNARD'S opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we may truely ſaie with the Apoſtle: That neither death, nor life, nor Angels, neither depth, nor hight can ſeparate vs from the Charitie of God, which is in Ieſus Chriſt, no, for no creature can take vs away by force from this holy Loue; but we onely can forſake and abandon it by our owne will, nor is there any other thing in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe to be feared.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So THEO: following the aduiſe of the holy
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2765:120"/> Councell, we ought to place our whole hope in God, who will perfect the work of our Saluation which he hath begun in vs, if we be not wanting to his grace: for we are not to thinke that he who ſaied to the Paralitike, goe and ſinne not, gaue him not alſo power to auoide that which he did prohibit him: and ſurely he would neuer exhort the faithfull to perſeuer, if he were not ready to furnish them with power required therto. Be faithfull till death ſaied he to the Bishop of SMIRNA and I will giue thee a crowne of Glorie; be diligent, and remaine in faith, labour couragiouſly, and comfort your ſelues, doe all your workes in Charitie; runne ſo, that you may obtaine the Priſe. We muſt eftſonnes with the great king demand of God the heauenly gift of Perſeuerance, and hope that he will grant it vs.</p>

And then, deare THEO. this ſoule wholy rauished with the loue of her well-beloued, putting before her eyes the multitude of fauours, and ſuccours wherwith she was preuented and helped, while she is yet in her pilgrimage, she doth inceſſantly kiſſe this ſweete helping hand, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted, drew, and ſupported her in the way; and confeſſeth, that it is of this diuine Sauiour that she holds her felicitie, ſeeing he had done for her all that the Patriarch IACOB wished for his iorney at ſuch time as he ſaw the Ladder to heauen. O Lord, ſaieth she then, thou waſt with me, and guided me in the way by which I came. Thou fedſt me with the bread of thy Sacraments; thou clothed'ſt me with the wedding garment of Charitie, thou haſt happily conducted me to this MANSION OF GLORIE, which is thy HOVSE, ô my eternall Father.

                     </l>
                  </q> Thus then we walke to eternall life, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of which the Diuine Prouidence ordained the number, diſtinction and ſucceſsion of graces neceſſarie to it, with their dependance of one another.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:2765:121"/>2. He willed firſt with a true will, that euen after the ſinne of ADAM all men should be ſaued: but vpon termes, and by meanes agreeable to the condition of their nature endewed with free-will, that is to ſaie he willed the ſaluation, of all thoſe that would contribute their conſent, to the graces and fauours, which he prepared, offered, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to this end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now amongſt theſe fauours, his will was, that VOCATION should be the firſt, and that it should be ſo accommodated to our LIBERTIE, that we might at our pleaſure accept or reiect it: and ſuch as he ſaw would receiue it, he would furnish with the ſacred motions of PENANCE; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to giue Charitie to ſuch as should ſecond theſe motions: to thoſe againe that were in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, he purpoſed to ſupplie with helpes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to PERSEVERANCE: and to ſuch, as should make vſe of theſe diuine helpes, he reſolued to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part finall Perſeuerance, and the glorious FELICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE of his eternall Loue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And thus we may giue a reaſon of the order which is found in the effects of PROVIDENCE ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſaluation, deſcending from the firſt to the laſt, that is from the fruite, which is GLORIE, to the roote of this faire tree, which is our Sauiours REDEMPTION. For the Diuine Bountie doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low MERITS with GLORIE, CHARITIE with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, PENNANCE with CHARITIE, OBEDIENCE to the firſt Vocation, with Penance. The VOCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION with obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the vocation, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours REDEMPTION with a vocation, vpon which Iacobs myſticall ladder doth reſt, as well towards

               <p n="5">5. And that this continuance of the effects of Prouidence was thus ordained, with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, which they haue of one another in the eternall will of God, the Holy Church, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of one of her ſolemne Praiers, doth witneſſe in theſe words: O ETERNALL and Almightie God who art Lord of the liuing and dead, and art mercifull to all thoſe, whom thou foreſeeſt are to be thine, by faith and works: as though she had acknowledged, that Glorie which is the encreaſe and fruite of Gods Mercy towards men, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely ordained for thoſe, whom the Diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had foreſeene, that in tract of time, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their vocation, they should attaine a liuely Faith, which work's by Charitie.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2765:125"/> no, FOR SHE IS THE DAVGHTER OF INCOMPARABLE DILECTION, the onely doue, the moſt perfect ſpouſe. Of this heauenly Queene, from my heart I pronounce, this louing, and true thought; that, at leaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of her mortall daies, her charitie paſſed that of the Seraphins: for though many Daughters heaped together riches, she ſurpaſſed the all. The Saints and Angels are but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to ſtarrs, and the prime of thoſe to the faireſt of theſe: but she is faire as the moone, as eaſie to be ſingled and diſcerned from all the Saints, as the Sunne from the ſtarrs. And yet I thinke further, that as the Charitie of this MOTHER OF LOVE ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells that of all the Saints of heauen in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo did she exerciſe it more perfectly, yea euen in this mortall life, neuer offending venially, as the Church eſteemes; she had then nor change nor ſtop in the way of Loue, but by a perpetuall aduancement aſcended from Loue to Loue. She neuer felt any contradiction of the ſenſuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; whence her Loue as a true SALOMON reigned peacebly in her ſoule, and was exerciſed at her pleaſure: the virginitie of her heart and bodie, was more worthy and honorable then that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. So that her ſpirit not diuided or ſeparated as S. PAVLE ſaieth, was occupied in diuine thoughts to pleaſe her God. And in fine a mothers loue, moſt preſsing, actiue, and ardent, an vnwearied and inſatiable loue, what could it not work in the heart of ſuch a mother, and for the heart of ſuch a ſonne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ah! doe not ſaie I pray you, that this virgin
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2765:125"/> was ſubiect to ſleepe, no, ſaie not ſo THEO: for doe you not ſee, that her ſleepe, is a ſleepe of Loue? ſo that it is euen her Spouſe his will, that she should ſleepe ſo long as she liſt; ah! take heede I coniure you ſaith he, that you awake not my well-beloued till she pleaſe. No THEO: this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Queene neuer ſlept but of loue, ſith she neuer gaue repoſe to her precious bodie, but to reenforce it, the better thence to ſerue God, which is a moſt excellent act of Charitie: for as the great S. Auguſtine ſaieth, Charitie doth oblige vs to loue our bodies conueniently, in ſo much as they are neceſſarie to good works; as they make a part of our perſon; and as they shall be partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of eternall felicitie: Certes a Chriſtian is to loue his bodie, as a liuing Image of our Sauiour incarnate, as iſſue of the ſame ſtocke, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of his kindred and conſanguinitie; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after we haue renewed the alliance, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing really the diuine bodie of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the moſt adorable Sacrament of the Altar, and when by Baptiſme, Confirmation and other Sacraments, we haue dedicated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated our ſelues to the Soueraigne Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But for the B. Virgine, ô God with what deuotion was she to loue her virginall bodie! not onely becauſe it was a ſweete, humble, pure bodie, obeiſſant to diuine Loue, and wholy embaumed with a thouſand ſacred ſweetes, but alſo for that it was the liuely ſource of our Sauiour's, and did ſo ſtrictly belong vnto him, by an incomparable dependance. For which cauſe, when she gaue her
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2765:126"/> angelicall bodie to the repoſe of ſleepe: goe to aied she, repoſe ô TABERNACLE OF ALLIANCE, ARKE OF SANCTITIE, THRONE OF THE DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITIE, eaſe thy ſelfe a little of thy wearineſſe, and repaire thy forces, by this ſweete repoſe.</p>

Beſides deare THEO: doe you not know that bad dreames, voluntarily procured by the dayes depraued thoughtes, are in ſome ſort ſinnes, in ſo much as they are dependances and executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the precedent malice? eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo the dreames which proceede from the holy affections of ſuch as are a wake be reputed vertuous and holy. O God THEO: what a conſolation it is to heare S.

O ſweete IESVS, what dreames was thy ſacred Mother to haue when she ſleept, her heart watching? Did she not dreame that she had thee yet folded in her wombe, as thou wa'ſt for nine monthes ſpace? or elſe hanging at her breaſts, and pretily preſſing the ſacred nible of her virginall dugge? Ah what ſweeteneſſe was in this ſoule! Paraduenture she dreamed, that as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour had often ſleept in her boſome, as a tender lampkin vpon his mothers flanke, ſo she ſleept in his pearced ſide, as a WHITE DOVE in the caue of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2765:126"/> an aſſured rocke: ſo that her ſleepe was wholy like to an extaſie, according to the operation of the ſpirit, though to the bodie it was a ſweete and gracious reſt and repoſe. But if euer she dreamed, as did the auncient Ioſeph, of her future greateneſſe; when in heauen she should be clothed with the Sunne, crowned with ſtarrs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the moone at her feete, that is, wholy enuironed with her ſonnes glorie, crowned with that of the Saints, and the world vnder her: or elſe, if as Iacob, she ſaw the progreſſe, and fruite of her ſonnes Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for the loue of Angells and men. THEO: who could euer imagine the immenſitie of ſo great delightes? ô what confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces with her deare child! what deliciouſneſſe from euery ſide!</p>
               <p n="5">5. But marke I pray you that I neither doe, nor will ſaie, that this ſo priuileged a Soule of the Mother of God, was depriued of the vſe of reaſon in her ſleepe. Many are of opinion that Salomon in that rare, yea, and true dreame, in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and receiued the gift of incomparable wiſdome, did truely exerciſe his free-will, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the iudicious eloquence of the diſcourſe he made; of his choice full of diſcretion; and the moſt excellent Praier which he vſed; and all theſe without any mixture of impertinences or diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of mind. But how much more reaſon is there, that the mother of the true Salomon, had the vſe of reaſon in her ſleepe, that is to ſaie, as Salomon himſelfe made her ſpeake, that her heart watched while she ſlept? Surely it was a farre greater mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that S. IOHN had the exerciſe of reaſon in his mothers wombe. And why then should we denie
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2765:127"/> her a leſſe, for whom, and to whom God did more fauours, then either he hath, or shall doe for all creaturs beſides?</p>
               <p n="6">6. To conclud, as the precious ſtone Abeſton doth by a perleleſſe proprietie conſerue for euer the fire which it hath conceiued: So the virgin-Mothers heart remained perpetually inflamed with holy loue which she receiued pf her ſonne: yet with this difference, that the Abeſtons fire as it cannot be extinguished, ſo it cannot be augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the diuine loue of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father towards his Sonne, is practiſed in one onely breathing mutually from them both, who in this ſort remaine vnited and tied together.

Yet there is a difference betwixt the raies which the Sunne doth caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our corporall eyes, and the light which God will create in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in Heauen: for the Sunn's raies doe not fortifie our corporall eyes when they are weake and vnable to ſee, but doth rather, dazle, waſte and blinde their infirme ſight: whereas contrariwiſe, this ſacred LIGHT OF GLORIE finding our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings weake and incapable to behould the Diuinitie, it doth raiſe, ſtrengthen, and perfect them ſo excellently, that by an incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible wonder, they doe behould and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the Abiſſe of the Diuine brightneſſe in it ſelfe, with a firme and ſtraight view, not being daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or repulſed by the infinit greatneſſe of it's ſplendour.</p>

This created light of the viſible Sunne, which is limited and finite, is in ſuch ſort all ſeene of all thoſe that doe behold it, that it is neuer totally ſeene of any one of them, nor of all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; It is in a manner ſo with all our ſenſes. Amongſt many that heare excellent muſike, though all of them heare it all, yet ſome heare it not ſo well, nor with ſo much delight as others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their eares, are leſſe, or more delicate.

But, ô eternall God, how is it poſsible, will you ſaie, that a ſoule that loues God, can neuer looſe it: for where loue is it reſiſteth ſinne, and how comes it to paſſe then, that ſinne gets entrie there, ſith that loue is ſtrong, as death; sharpe in battaile, as hell? how can the forces of deth, or hell, that, is ſinne, vanquish loue; which at leaſt doth equalize them in ſtrength, and doth paſſe them in friends, and right?

My deare THEO: the heauens them ſelues ſtand amazed; their ports doe burſt with feare; and the Angels of peace are loſt in aſtoniſhment, at this prodigious miſerie of mans heart, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo amiable a good, to ioyne it ſelfe to things ſo deplorable. But haue you neuer ſeene the little marueill, which euery one knowes, and yet few knows the reaſon of it? when a full barrill is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the wine will not runne, vnleſſe it haue aire giuen from aboue, which yet happens not to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels already drawen on; for they are no ſooner open, but the wine runnes. Certes in this mortall life, though our ſoules abound with heauenly loue, yet are they neuer ſo full therwith, that by temptation this loue may not depart: but in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when the ſweeteneſſe of Gods beautie shall occupie all our vnderſtanding, and the delightes of his Goodneſſe shall wholy ſatiate our wills, ſo that there shall be nothing which the fullneſſe of his loue shall not replenish; no obiect, though it penetrate euen to our hearts, can euer draw, or make ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne one ſole drope of the precious liquour of our heauenly loue. And to think to giue aire aboue, that is, to deceiue, or ſurpriſe the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it shall no more be poſsible; for it shall be immouable, in the apprehenſion of the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne TRVTH.</p>

But being in heauen, where, as in the great feaſt deſcribed by Iſaie, there shall be wine purified from the dregges, we shall be no longer ſubiect to change, but shall be inſeparably vnited by loue to our ſoueraigne good. Here, in the twie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>light of day breake, we are affraide, that in lieu of the Spouſe, we fall vpon ſome other obiect, which may delay, and deceiue vs; but when we shall find him aboue where he takes his repaſt, and repoſe, in the cleare day of glorie, there will be no occaſion to be deceiued: for his light will be too cleare, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ſweeteneſſe will tye vs ſo cloſely to his good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, that we shall not haue the power, to will to vntye our ſelues.</p>

We are like to Corall, which in the ſea, the place of it's origine, is pale-greene, weake, bowing, and a pliable shrub: but being pulled out of the ſea as from it's mothers wombe, it becomes almoſt a ſtone, firme and impliable, changing it's pale-greene into a liuely vermillion; for ſo we (being as yet amidſt the ſea of this world, the place of our birth) are obnoxius to ſtrang changes pliable vpon euery occaſion, by inſpiration, to the right hand of heauenly loue; by temptation, to the left of terrene loue. But if, being once drawen out of this mortalitie, we shall haue changed the pale-greene of our doubtfull hopes, into the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red of aſſured fruition, we shall neuer more be moueable, but make a ſetled demoure for euer

So charitie is ſometimes ſo quelled, and made to languish in the heart, that it doth ſcarcely appeare in any action, though yet the remaine entire in the ſupreame region of the ſoule: And then it is, that vnder the multitude of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2765:141"/> veniall ſinns, as vnder finders, the fire of holy Loue remaines couert, its light being ſmothered, though not deaded, or extinguished: for as the preſence of the Diamant doth hinder the exerciſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Adamants propertie in drawing iron, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet doth not depriue her of it, hauing her opera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſoone as the obſtackle is remoued: ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence of veniall ſinns, doth in no ſort depriue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of her force and power to worke, yet doth it as it were benume, and depriue her of the vſe of her actiuitie. So that she remaines ſterill and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, without action. Certes nor veniall, nor yet the affection to veniall ſinne, is contrarie to the eſſentiall reſolution of charitie, which is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre God before all things; becauſe by this ſinne, we loue things beſides reaſon, not againſt reaſon; we deferre a little too much, and more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to creatures, yet doe not we preferre them before the Creator; we make more delay then is fitting in terrene things, yet doe we not for all that forſake heauenly things; In fine this kind of ſinne doth impeach vs in the way of charitie, but doth not put vs out of it, and therefore veniall ſinne not being contrarie to Charitie, it neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroies her either wholy, or partially.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God ſignified to the Bishope of Epheſus, that he had forſaken his prime charitie; when he ſaieth not that he was without charitie, but onely that he was not ſuch, as in the beginning, that is that he was not now prompt, feruent, flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and frutefull; as we are wount to ſaie of him, who was braue, cheerefull and frolicke, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards becomes harsh, dull, and lowtish, that he is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2765:141"/> now the ſame man he was; for our meaning is not that he is not the ſame in ſubſtance, but onely in his actions, and exerciſes. And euen our Sauiour ſaieth, that in the later daies, the charitie of many shall waxe cold, that is, she shall not be ſo actiue and couragious, by reaſon of feare, and griefe which shall oppreſſe mens hearts. Sure it is that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued doth enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſinne; but this ſinne, though ſinne indeede, doth not ſtill beget the death of the ſoule, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely when it is compleate in malice, and when it is conſummate and accomplished, as S.

Howbeit veniall ſinne is ſinne, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſpleaſant to Charitie, not as a thing that is contrarie to her, but contrarie to her ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and progreſſe, yea her intention, which in ſo much as we are to direct all our actions to God is violated by veniall ſinne, which carrying the actions, by which they are committed, not indeede againſt God, yet beſides God, and his will: and as we ſaie of a tree rudely dight, and shaker. by a tempeſt, that nothing is left, becauſe though the tree be entire, yet is it left without fruite; ſo when our charitie is shaken by the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we haue to veniall ſinne, we ſaie she is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, and weakned, not for that the habits of loue are not entire in our hearts, but becauſe she is without the workes, which are the fruites.</p>

This affection glewing vs too hard to the enioying of creaturs, depriues vs of the ſpirituall priuicie betwixt God and vs, to which charitie, as true friendshipe doth incite vs, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this affection doth make vs looſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour helpes and aſsiſtances, which are as the vitall SPIRITS of the ſoule, in default whereof there followeth a certaine ſpirituall Palſie, which in the end, if it be not remedied, leedes vs to death; for to conclude, charitie being an actiue qualitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long without either acting, or dying.

When we doe not then make vſe of the Charitie which is in vs, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we doe not applie our minds to the exerciſes of holy loue, but keepe them buſied in ſome other affaire, or elſe being ſlothfull they remaine vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and idle, then THEO: they may be aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome bad obiect, and ſurpriſed by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And though the habite of charitie be at that inſtant, in the bottome of our hearts, and performe its office, inclining vs to reiect the bad ſuggeſtion, yet doth it not vrge or carrie vs to the action of reſiſtance, but according as we ſecond it as the manner of habits is; and therefore leauing vs in our freedome it happens often, that the bad obiects hauing throwen their allurements deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our hearts, we ioyne our ſelues vnto them by an exceſsiue complacence, which after encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, we can hardly be quit of it; and as thornes, according to the ſaying of our Sauiour, doe in the end ſtilfe the ſeede of grace, and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly loue. So it fell-out with our firſt Mother Eue, whoſe ouerthrow began by a certaine amuſement, which she made in diſcourſing with the Serpent, taking complacence to heare of her aduancement in knowledge, and to ſee the beautie of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruite: ſo that the complacence waxing bigge with the amuſement, and the amuſement feeding it ſelfe in the complacence, she found her ſelfe at length ſo entangled, that giuing way to conſent, she did commit the accurſed ſinne, to which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards she drew her husband.</p>

Alas, THEO: if we did not ſtand muſing at the vanitie of fraile pleaſurs eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the complacence of ſelfe-loue, but hauing once got charitie, would be carefull to flie ſtraight whither she would carrie vs; ſuggeſtion, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation should neuer catch vs: but becauſe, as doues ſeduced and beguiled by ſelfe-eſteeme, we looke backe vpon our ſelues, and keepe our minds too much conuerſant amongſt creaturs, we often find our ſelues in our enemies clawes, who beare away, and deuoure vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God will not hinder that temptation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault vs, to th'end that by reſiſtance, our charitie may be more exerciſed, that by fight we may beare away the victorie; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by victorie obtaine the triumphe. But that we haue any kind of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to delight our ſelues in the temptation, this riſeth from the condition of our nature, which doth ſo earneſtly loue Good, that therby she is ſubiect to be enticed by any thing that hath a shew of good; and temptations hooke is ſtill baited with this kind of baite: for as holy writ doth teach, there is either ſome honorable good in the worlds ſight, to moue vs to the pride of a wordly life; or a good delightfull to ſenſe, to carrie vs to carnall concupiſcence; or a good able to enrich vs, to incite vs to auarice and couetouſneſſe of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2765:144"/> eyes. But if we keepe faith, which can diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the true Good we are to purſue, and the falſe which we are to reiect, liuelily attetiue to its office, without doubt it will be a faithfull Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell to Charitie, and will giue her intelligence of the euill that might approch the heart, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Good, and Charitie would ſodenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe it. But becauſe ordinarily, we keepe our faith either a ſleepe, or leſſe attentiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the conſeruation of Charitie; we are often ſurpriſed by temptation, which ſeducing our ſenſes, and they inciting the inferiour part of our ſoule to rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it comes to paſſe eftſones that the ſuperiour part of reaſon yeeldes to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of this reuoult, and by committing the ſinne, looſeth Charitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such was the progreſſe of the ſedition which the diſloiall Abſolon ſtirred vp againſt his good Father DAVID; for he laied before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple faire propoſitions in apparence, which being receiued by the poore Iſraelites, whoſe prudence was put a ſleepe and ſmothered, he did ſollicite them in ſuch ſort, that he wrought them to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire rebellion; ſo that the monefull Dauid was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Indeede our ſoule doth not goe out of our bodie by little a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d little, but in a moment, when the bodies indiſpoſitions are ſo great, that she can no longer exerciſe the actions of life therein: euen ſo at the very inſtant, in which the heart is ſo diſordered by paſsions, that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie there can no longer raigne, she quits and abandons it: for she is ſo generous, that she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p n="2">2. Habits gotten by human actions alone, doe not perish by one onely contrarie act: for a man is not ſaied to be intemperate, for one onely act of intemperance, nor is a painter held an vnskilfull maiſter, for hauing once failed in his arte; but as all ſuch habits are gotten by the impreſsion and in ſequele of diuers acts, ſo we looſe them by a long ceſſation from their acts, or by many contrarie acts. But Charitie THEO: which in a moment the holy Ghoſt poures into our hearts, as ſoone as the conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to this infuſion meete in vs; is alſo in an inſtant expelled thence, as ſoone as diuerting our will from the obedience due vnto God, we haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished conſent to the rebellion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialtie to which temptation incites vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. True it is, Charitie encreaſeth by degrees, and goeth from perfection to perfection, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as by our works, or by the frequenting of Sacraments, we make it place: yet doth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe by a leſſening of perfection thereof: for we neuer looſe any bit of it, but we looſe it all. In which it reſembles PHIDIAS his Maiſter-peece ſo famous amongſt the Auncients: for they ſaie, this great Grauer, made in Athe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a picture of Minerua of Iuorie twentie ſeauen cubits high, and in her Buckler, wherein he expreſſed the battails of the Amaſons and Giants, he graued his owne pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with ſo great Arte, that one could not take away one iot of it, ſaieth Ariſtotle, without defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the whole ſtatue, ſo that this worke though it was perfected by adding peice to peice, yet in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2765:146"/> a moment might be deſtroied, by remouing any little parcell of the workmans feature. In like maner THE: though the Holy Ghoſt hauing infuſed Charitie into a ſoule, doth e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>creaſe it by adding one degree to another, and one perfection of loue to another, yet ſo, as that the reſolution to preferre God's will before all things, being the eſſentiall point of holy loue, and that wherein the image of eternall loue, that is, of the Holy Ghoſt, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, one cannot withdraw one onely peece of it, but preſently Charitie doth wholy perish.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This preference of God before all things, is the deare child of Charitie. And if AGAR being an Egiptian, ſeeing her ſonne in danger of death, had not the heart to ſtay by him but would haue left him, ſaying ah! I am not able to ſee this child dye; is it ſtrang then, that Charitie the daughter of ſweeteneſſe and heauenly delight cannot ſee her child dye, which is a Reſolution neuer to offend God? ſo that ſtill as free-will reſolues to conſent to ſinne, and therein killeth this holy reſolution Charitie dyes with it, fighing out theſe laſt words: alas no, neuer will I ſee this child dye. In fine, THE: as the precious ſtone called PRASSIVS, looſeth its luſter in the preſence of any poiſon; ſo in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the ſoule looſeth her ſplendour, grace and beautie which conſiſteth of holy loue, vpon the entrie and preſence of any mortall ſinne; whence it is written, that the ſoule who ſinneth shall dye.</p>

AS it were a moſt wicked impudencie, to attribute the works of holy loue done by the holy ghoſt, in, and with vs to the ſtrength of our will; ſo were it a shameleſſe impietie, to lay the defect of loue in vngratfull men, on the want of heauenly aſsiſtance and grace. For the holy Ghoſt cries in euery place to the contrarie, that our ruine is from our ſelues: that our Sauiour brought the fire of loue and deſires nothing but that it should burne our hearts: That ſaluation is prepared before the face of all nations, light to lighten the gentiles, and for the glorie of Iſrael. That the diuine goodneſſe would haue none to perish but that all come to the knowledge of truth, that all be ſaued, their Sauiour being come into the world, that euery one might receiue the adoption of children: And the wiſeman doth clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely aduertiſe vs. Saie not, it ſtikes of God: And the ſacred Concell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doth inculcate diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the children of the holy Church, that the Grace of God is neuer awa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, to ſuch as doe what they can, inuoking the diuine aſsiſtance. That God doth neuer abandon ſuch as he hath once iuſtified, vnleſſe they abandon him firſt. So
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2765:147"/> that if they be not a wanting to grace, they shall obtaine glorie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In fine THEO: our Sauiour, is a light which doth illuminate euery one that comes into the world. Diuers trauellers in a ſummers day about noone-tyde lay downe to repoſe in the shade of a tree, but while their wearineſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the cooleneſſe of the shadowe keepes them a ſleepe, the Sunne aduancing himſelfe towards them, gaue iuſt vpon their eies his ſtrongeſt light, which by the glitter of his brightneſſe, made tranſparences, as with ſmale raies, about the Aple of thoſe sleepers eyes, and by the heate which pearced their eyelids, forced them by a gentle violence to awake, but ſome of them being awaked got vp, and aduancing, came happily to their lodging, the reſt, did not onely not riſe, but turning their backes to the ſunne, and pulling their hats ouer their eyes, there ſpent the day in ſleeping, till ſurpriſed by night, being yet willing to make towards their lodging, they ſtraied hither and thither in the Foreſt, at the mercy of mercileſſe wolues, and other ſauage bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. Now tell me I praie, THEO: thoſe that arriued, ought they not to aſſcribe all their contentment to the ſunne, or to ſpeak like a Chriſtian, to the ſunns Creatour? yes ſurely: for it was high time, and yet they dream't not of riſing: the ſunne did them this good office; and by a gentle warning, of his light and heate, came louingly to call them vp. T'is true they reſiſted not his call, but he alſo helped them much euen in that; for he ſpred his light fairely vpon them, giuing them a glimps of himſelfe through their eyelids, and by his heate as

               <p n="3">3. Contrariwiſe theſe poore ſtrayers, were they not, to blame to crie in the woode Alas, what haue we done to the ſunne that he made vs not ſee his light, as he did our Companions, that we might haue arriued at our lodgings, and not haue wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in theſe hideous obſcurities? for who would not vndertake the ſunns, or rather Gods cauſe, my deare THEO: to anſwere theſe vnfortunate wretches.

See, ſee now THEO: what I would ſaie, we are all pilgrims in this mortall life, almoſt all of vs haue willingly ſlept in ſinne; God the ſunne of Iuſtice darts vpon vs moſt ſufficiently, yea abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the beames of his inſpirations, warmes our hearts with his benedictions, touching euery one with the allurements of his loue; ah how chance it then that theſe allurements allure ſo few, and yet draw fewer; ah, certainly, ſuch as firſt allured, afterwards drawen, doe follow the inſpiration, haue great occaſion to ioye, but not to glorie in it: Let them ioye becauſe they enioy a great good; yet let them not glorie in it, becauſe it is by Gods

Why did then the one, and not the other in effect produce the pearle? The heauens were as bountifull to her that remained ſterill, as was requiſite to impearle, and beget in her a faire vnion, but she hindred the effect of the heauens fauour, by keeping herſelfe cloſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d couert.

THEO: if we loue God, his be the honour, and glorie, who did all in vs, and without whom, nothing was done; ours be the profit, and obligation: for it is a shareing of his diuine goodneſſe with him, he leaues vs the fruits of his benefits, reſerues to himſelfe the honour, and praiſe thereof; and verily ſith we are nothing but by his grace, we ought to be nothing, but to his glorie.</p>

For our temeritie vrgeth vs ſtill to ſearch; why God giues more meanes to one then to another; why he did not the miracles amongſt the Tyrians, and Sidonians, which he did in Corozain, and Bethſaida, ſeeing they would haue made as good vſe of them. In fine why he drawes rather one then another to his loue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. O THEO: my friend, neuer, no neuer, muſt we permit our minds to be carried away with a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2765:151"/> whirlewinde, or thinke to find a better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods will, then the ſame will, which is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignely reaſonable, yea the reaſon of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the rule of all goodneſſe, the lawe of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. And although the holy ghoſt, ſpeaking in the holy Scripture, giues reaſon in diuers parts, of almoſt all that we can wish to know, touching that which this prouidence doth, in conducting men to holy loue, and eternall ſaluation; yet in diuers occaſions he shewes, that he ought in no wiſe, renounce the reſpect which is due to his will, whoſe purpoſe, decree, pleaſure, and reſolution we are to adore; in concluſion whereof, as ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Iudge, and ſoueraignely iuſt, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that he should manifeſt his motiues, but it is ſufficient, that he ſaie ſimply (and for reaſon) that if we ought charitably to beare ſo much reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Decrees of ſoueraigne Courts, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of corruptible Iudges of the earth, and of earth, as to beleeue that they were not made without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, though we know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not?

               <p n="4">4. So in a thouſand places of the holy word we find the reaſon, why God reproued the Iewes, becauſe, ſaieth S. PAVLE, and S.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2765:152"/> neuertheleſſe, this reaſon muſt not be examined by mans wit, which contrariwiſe is obliged to reſt purely and ſimply in reuerencing the Diuine Decree: Admiring it with loue, as infinitly iuſt and vpright; and louing it with admiration, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable, and incomprehenſible. So that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Apoſtle concluds the long diſcourſe which he had made of it. O the profunditie of the riches and wiſdome of the knowledge of God, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible are his iudgments and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable his wayes! who doth know the thougtes of our Lord, or who hath bene his Counſellour? By which exclamation he teſtifieth that God doth all things with great wiſdome, knowledge, and reaſon; yet ſo, that not hauing entred into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine counſells, whoſe iudgments and deſignes are infinitly placed aboue our reach, we ought deuot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adore his Decrees as moſt iuſt, without ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the motiues, which he keepes to himſelfe, that ſo he might keepe our vnderſtanding at home, in respect and humilitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. S.

Verily it is ſufficient for a Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as yet by faith, and not ſeeing that which is perfect, but onely knowing in part, to know and beleeue that God deliuers none from damnation, but by his free mercy, through our Lord IESVS-CHRIST;

We ſee ſometimes twins whereof the one is borne aliue and receiues Baptiſme, the other in his birth looſe his temporall life, before he be regenerated to the eternall, and conſequently the one is heire of heauen, the other is depriued of the inheritance.

And truely this is a ſolide anſwere. But
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2765:153"/> following the aduiſe of diuine S. PAVLE, and S.

Then ſaieth S.

Entering into a Clok-makers shoppe, we shall ſometimes find a cloke, no greater then an Oringe, which yet hath in it an hundred, or two hundred peices, whereof ſome ſerue for the ſtyle, others to ſtricke the houre, or giue the morning ALARME; you shall ſee in it little wheeles one turning to the right,

And we know in generall, that theſe ſo diuerſly ordered peices, ſerue all either to point out, as a hand, God's moſt holy iuſtice, or, as a bell of praiſe, to ſound the triumphant mercy of his goodneſſe. But to know the particular vſe of euery peice how it is ordered to the generall end or why it is made ſo, we cannot conceiue, vnleſſe the ſoueraigne workman inſtruct vs; Now he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals his Art from vs, to th'end that with more reuerence we might admire it, till in heauen he shall rauish vs with the ſweeteneſſe of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where in the aboundance of his loue he will diſcouer vnto vs the reaſons, meanes, and motiues of all that paſſed in the world, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage

               <p n="1">1. THe life of a man who languishing on his deathes bed, by little and little decaies, doth hardly deſerue to be termed life, ſith that, though it be life, yet is it ſo mingled with death, that it is hard to ſaie, whether it is a death as yet liuing, or a life dying. Alas! how pitifull a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle it is THE: but farre more lamentable is the ſtate of a ſoule, which vngratfull to her Sauiour goes hourely backward, withdrawing her-ſelfe from God's loue, by certaine degrees of indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſloyaltie, till at length hauing quite forſaken it, she is left in the horrible obſcuritie of perdition: and this loue which is in it's declining and which fades, and perisheth, is called imperfect loue, becauſe though it be entire in the ſoule, yet ſeemes it not to be entirely; that is, it hardly keepes in the ſoule any longer, but is vpon the point of forſaking it. Now Charitie being ſeparated from
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2765:156"/> the ſoule by ſinne, there remaines oftentimes a certaine reſemblance of Charitie, which doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and put vs into a vaine muſe; and I will tell you what it is. Charitie while it is in vs, produceth many actions of loue towards God, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſe whereof, our ſoule gets a habit, and cuſtome of louing God, which is not Charitie, but onely an impreſsion and inclination, which the multitude of actions leaues in our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After a long habit of preaching or ſaying Maſſe deliberatly, it happens often, that in drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming we vtter and ſpeake the ſame things, which we would ſaie in preaching or celebrating, ſo that cuſtome and habit acquired by election, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is in ſome ſort, afterward practiſed without election, or vertue, ſith the actions of ſuch as ſleepe, generally ſpeaking, haue nothing of vertue, ſaue onely an apparent image, and are onely the ſimilitudes or repreſentations thereof. So charitie by the multitude of actes which she produceth doth impri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in vs a certaine facilitie to loue, which she leaues in vs, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after we are depriued of her pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence. I remember when I was a young ſcholler that in a village neare Paris, there was a certaine well with an ECHO, which would repeate the words that we pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by it, diuers times. And if ſome Idiote without experience, had heard this repetition of words, he would haue beleeued that there had bene ſome bodie in the botome of the well, who had done it. But we had euen then knowen by Philoſophie, that none was in the well, to reiterate our words, but that there were onely certaine concauities, in ſome one whereof
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2765:157"/> our voices were aſſembled, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not finding through paſſage, leaſt they might altogether perish, and not imploy the force that was left them, they produced ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d voices; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they gathering together in an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cauitie, produced a third, the third a fourth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo conſequetly to the eleauenth, ſo that thoſe voices heard in the well, were not now our voices, but reſemblances and images of the ſame. And indeede there was a great difference betwixt our voices, and thoſe: For when we made a long continuance of words, we had but ſome few of them rendred by the ECHO, shortning the pronunciation of ſyllables, which she ſlightly paſſed ouer, with tones and accents quite different from ours; nor did she begin to forme her words, till we had quite pronounced them. In fine they were not words of a liuing man, but as one would ſaie the words of any emptie, and vaine Rocke, which notwithſtanding did ſo well counterfeit man's voice, whence she ſprung, that a ſimple bodie, would haue bene miſled and beguiled by her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now this is it that I would ſaie when holy CHARITIE meets a pliable ſoule, wherein she doth long reſide she produceth a ſecond loue, which is not a loue of Charitie, though it iſſue from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but it is a humane loue which is yet ſo like to Charitie, that though she leaues behind, this her picture, and likeneſſe which doth ſo repreſent her, that one who were ignorant would be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therein; not vnlike to the birds on Zeuxis his painted rayſins, which they deemed to be true rayſins, ſo generally had Art imitated nature!
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2765:157"/> And yet there is a faire difference betwixt Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and humane loue which she doth beget in vs: for the voice of Charitie doth pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and worke in our hearts Gods Commandments, humane loue which remaines after her, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede pronounce the commandments, and denounceth ſometimes all of them, yet doth neuer effect them all, but ſome few onely: Charitie doth pronounce, and put together all the ſillables, that is, all the circumſtances of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dments: humane Loue alwayes leaues out ſome of them: eſpecially ſtraightneſſe, and puritie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: and as for the tone, Charitie takes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at an equall hight, ſweete and delightfull; humane Loue takes it ſtill either to high in terrene things or to low in celeſtiall; and neuer ſets vpon his worke, till Charitie haue ended hers: for ſo long as charitie is in the ſoule, she ſerues her ſelfe of this humane loue, as of her Creature, and makes vſe of him to facilitate her operations; ſo that in that interim, the workes of this loue, as of a ſeruant, belong to Charitie his Miſtreſſe. But Charitie flitting the actions of this loue are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely his owne, not hauing their eſtimation, and worth from Charitie; for as Eliſeus his ſtafe, in his abſence, though in the hand of his ſeruant Geizi, who receiued it from him, wrought no miracle, ſo actions done in the abſence of Charitie, by the onely habit of humane loue, are of no value or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to eternall life, though he learned them of charitie, being but her ſeruant. And this comes thus to paſſe, becauſe this humane loue in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Charitie, hath not any ſupernaturall
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2765:158"/> ſtrength, to raiſe the ſoule to the excellent action of the loue of God aboue all things.</p>

Where the Hart hath lodged by night, the morning after there is a fresh ſent or vent of him, towards night it is harder to be tooke; but as ſoone as his ſtraine waxeth old, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dead, the hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des doe begin to looſe it.

               <p n="4">4. I haue ſeene certaine young people, well bred vp in the loue of God, who putting them ſelues out of that path remained for ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt their accurſed ruine, in whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, one might haue ſeene great markes of their former vertue, and the habit gotten in time of charitie, reſiſting preſent vice, ſcarcely could one for ſome monthes, diſcerne whether they were out of Charitie or not, whether vertious, or vitious, till ſuch time as the progreſſe did cleare, that theſe vertuous exerciſes proceeded not from Charitie preſent, but paſt: not from perfect, but imperfect loue, which Charitie had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her, as a ſigne that she had lodged in thoſe ſoules.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now this imperfect loue, THEO: is good in it ſelfe, for being a creature of holy Charitie and one of her retinue, it cannot but be good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede did faithfully ſerue charitie, while she ſeiour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in the ſoule, as it is ſtill readie to ſerue, vpon her returne, nor is it to be contemned, for that it cannot doe actions of perfect loue; the condition of its nature being ſuch: ſo ſtarres, which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the ſunne are very imperfect, are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely beautifull beheld alone; and hauing no ranke in the preſence of the ſunne, in his abſence they haue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Howbeit as this loue is good in vs, ſo it is perilous for vs, ſeeing that oftentimes we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with it alone, becauſe hauing many interiour

If IACOB had not left his perfect Rachell, but had keept ſtill by her the day of his marriage, he had not bene deceiued as he was; but permitti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g her to goe into the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber without him he was holy aſtonished in the morning following, to find onely in lieu of her, the imperfect Lia which yet he beleeued had bene his deare Rachell; But Laban had put that deceit vpon him.

If examining in particular the obiects of the deſires, affections and deſignes which you haue for the preſent, you find any one for which you would tranſgreſſe the good will and pleaſure of God, by ſinning mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, it is then out of doubt, that all the feeling facilitie and promptitude which you haue in Gods ſeruice, iſſue from no other ſource then humane and imperfect loue: for if perfect loue raigned in vs, ô Lord God! it would breake euery affection, euery deſire, euery deſigne, whoſe obiect were ſo pernicious, and would not indure that our heart, should behould it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But note that I ſaied that this examine muſt be made vpon our preſent affections; for it is not requiſite, that you should imagine to your ſelfe ſuch as may ariſe hereafter, ſith it is ſufficient that we be faithfull in preſent occurrences, according to the diuerſitie of times; and ſith that euery time hath enough to doe, with it's owne paine and trauell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet if you were deſirous to exerciſe your heart in ſpirituall valour, by the repreſentation of diuers encounters, and aſſaults, you may profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doe it, prouided, that after the acts of this imaginarie valour, which your heart might haue made, you eſteeme not your ſelfe more valliant: for the children of Ephraim, who did wonders with their bow and arrowes, while they were yet trained vp in warlike feates at home, when it came indeede to the push, vpon the day of battell they turned their backes and had not ſo much as the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2765:160"/> courage to bow their arrowes, or behold thoſe of their enemies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When therefore we doe practiſe this valour in future occurrences, or ſuch as are onely poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we find a good and loyall feeling, we are to thanke God for it: For this feeling is alwayes good, howbeit we are to keepe our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a confidence and diffidence, hoping that by Gods grace, we should doe in the occaſion, that which we imagined; and yet ſtill fearing, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our ordinarie miſerie, peraduenture we should performe nothing, but looſe courage; but if the diffidence should waxe ſo exceſsiue, that it ſeemed to vs, that we should neither haue force, nor heart, and thereby we should fale into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, vpon the ſubiect of imaginarie temptations, as though we were not in Charitie, and in Gods grace; then, in deſpight of our feeling and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, we were to make reſolution of a great fidelitie in all occurrences, euen to the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which troubles vs, hoping that when it shall happen, God will multiplie his grace, redouble his ſuccours, and afforde vs all neceſſarie aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; and while he giues vs not the force for an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie and vnneceſſarie warre, he will giue it vs when it comes to the deede: For as many haue loſt courage in the aſſault, ſo many haue alſo loſt feare and haue taken heart, and reſolution in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of danger and difficultie, which in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence they had neuer done. And ſo many of Gods ſeruants, repreſenting vnto themſelues abſent temptations, haue bene affrighted at them, euen almoſt to the looſing of courage, which when

Finally in the amazements which riſe from the repreſentation of future aſſaults, when we apprehend that our heart failes vs, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that we haue a deſire of courage, and confidence that God will beſtowe it vpon vs when time shall exact. Nor had SAMSON alwayes his ſtrength, but it is noted in the Scripture, that the Lion of Tamathas vines, comming towards him furiouſly and roring, the Spirit of God ſeaſed him, that is, God gaue him the motion of a new force, and a new courage, and he tore the Lion in pieces, as a Gote: and in like manner when he defeated the thouſand Philiſtians, which thought to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him in the field of Lechi.

               <p n="2">2. Now this motion is practiſed towards God
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2765:161"/> in this manner.

Now when we haue brought our vnderſtanding to be very attentiue, to the greatneſſe of the Goods that are in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine obiect; it is impoſsible but our will should be touched with complacence in this good, and then we vſe the libartie and power which we haue ouer our ſelues, prouoking our owne heart, to anſwere and ſtrengthen this firſt complacence, by acts of approbation, and reioycing. O ſaieth the deuote ſoule in this caſe, how faire thou art my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, how faire thou art, thou art wholy deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reable, yea thou art deſire it ſelfe!

               <p n="1">1. THe loue which we beare to God doth flow from the firſt complacence that our heart takes, vpon the apprehenſion of the diuine Goodneſſe, when it begins to tend towards the ſame. Now when by the exerciſe of loue we doe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2765:166"/> augment, and ſtrengthen this firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placence, as we haue declared in the precedent Chapters, we then draw into our hearts the diuine perfections, and enioye the Diuine Goodneſſe, by the delight we take in it, practiſing the firſt part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of loue expreſſed by the ſacred ſpouſe, ſaying: my well-beloued is myne. But becauſe this complacence of loue being in vs that haue it, is alſo in God, in whom we take it, it giues vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally to his Diuine Goodneſſe, ſo that by this holy loue of complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we enioye the goods which are in God, as though they were our owne; but becauſe the diuine perfections, are ſtronger then our Spirit, entring into it, they enioye it reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally, in ſo much, that we doe not onely ſaie God is ours by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placence, but that we are his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The hearbe Aproxis (as elſewhere we haue ſaied) hath ſo great a correſpondance with fire, that, though in diſtance, as oone as it gets into the aſpect of it, it draweth the flame, and begins to burne, conceiuing fire, not ſo much from the heate, as from the light of the fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. When then by this attraction it is vnited to the fire, if it could ſpeake, might it not well ſaie, my well-beloued fire is myne, ſith I drew it to me and enioye its flames: but I am alſo his, for though I drew it to me, it reduced me into it, as more ſtrong, and noble; it is my fire, and I am its hearbe, I draw it, and it burnes me. So our heart being brought into the preſence of the Diuine Goodneſſe, and hauing drawen the perfections thereof by the complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it takes in them, may truely ſaie, Gods Goodneſſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2765:167"/> is all myne, ſith I enioye his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I againe am wholy his, ſeeing his delightes enioye me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By complacence, our ſoule as a Gedeons fleece, is wholy filled with heauenly dewe, and this dewe is the fleeces, becauſe it fell vpon it; and and againe the fleece is the dewes, becauſe it was ſteeped in it, and receiued vertue from it. Which doth more belong to the other, the pearle or the oyſter to the pearle? The pearle is the oyſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she drew it to her, but the oyſter is the pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, becauſe it giues her worth and value. Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence makes vs Poſſeſſours of God, drawing into vs his perfections; but it makes vs alſo poſſeſſed of God, applying and tying vs to his perfections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now in this complacence, we doe glut our ſoule with delights, in ſuch a manner, that we doe not yet ceaſe to deſire to be glutted, and taſteing the diuine Bountie, we deſire yet to taſte it, in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating our ſelues, we would ſtill eate, and in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we perceiue our ſelues ſatiated. The head of the Apoſtles, hauing ſaied in his firſt Epiſtle, that the old Prophets had manifeſted the graces which were to abound amongſt Chriſtians, and amongſt other things our Sauiours paſsion, and the glorie which was to follow it, as well by the Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his bodie, as alſo by the Exaltation of his name: In the end he concluds that the very Angels doe deſire to behold the myſteries of the Redemption in this diuine Sauiour, whom, ſaieth he, the Angels doe deſire to behold. But how can this be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that the Angels who ſee the Redeemour, and in him all the myſteries of our ſaluation, doe yet deſire to ſee him? THEO: Verily they ſee him
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2765:167"/> continually, but with a viewe ſo agreeable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that the complacence they take in it doth ſatiate them, without taking away their deſire, and makes them deſire without remouing their Sacietie, the fruition is not leſſened by the deſire, but perfected therby, as their deſire is not cloied but sharpned by the fruition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fruition of a thing which doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually content, doth neuer fade, but is renewed, and flourisheth inceſſantly, it is ſtill agreeable, ſtill amiable; The continuall contentment of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly louers, produceth a deſire perſeuerantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as their continuall deſire, doth beget in them, a contentment perſeuerantly deſired. The good which is finite, in giuing the poſſeſsion doth end the deſire, and in giuing the deſire doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe, while it cannot at once be poſſeſſed and deſired: But the infinite Good, makes deſire raigne with poſſeſſion, and poſſeſſion with deſire, finding a way to ſaciate deſire by a holy preſence, and yet make it liue by the greatneſſe of its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie which doth nourish in all thoſe that poſſeſſe it, a continually contented deſire, and a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continually deſired.</p>

So we ſee mothers doe deeply condole the afflictions of their onely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the Scripture doth often teſtifie. How great was the ſorrow of Agars heart, vpon the griefe of her Iſmael, whom she ſaw well nigh pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with thirſt in the Deſert: How much did DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDS ſoule commiſerate the miſerie of his Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: Ah doe you not marke the motherly heart of the great Apoſtle, ſicke, with the ſicke: burning

Alas the ſame Nailes that crucified the bodie of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine child, did alſo crucifie the mothers heart; the ſame thrones which pearced his head, did ſtrike through the heart of this entirely ſweete mother: she endured the ſame miſeries with her ſonne by commiſeration; the ſame dolours, by condoling; the ſame paſsions by compaſsion: to be short, the ſworde of death which tranſpearced the bodie of this beſt beloued ſonne did ſtricke through the heart of this moſt louing mother; whence she might well haue ſaied, that he was to her a POSIE OF MIRRHE amidſt her breaſtes, that is, in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and in the midſt of her heart. IACOB, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſad, though falſe, newes of the death of his deare IOSEPH, you ſee how he is afflicted with it: ah! ſaied he, in ſorrow I will deſcend to hell, that is to ſaie, to Lymbo, into ABRAHAMS boſome, after this child.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Commiſeration is alſo great according to the greatneſſe of their ſufferances whom we loue: for how little ſoeuer the frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshipe be, if the euells which we ſee endured be extreame they cauſe in vs great pitie. This made Ceſar weepe ouer Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey; and the daughters of Hieruſalem could not ſtay themſelues from weeping ouer our Sauiour; though the greater part of them, did not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

But beſids all this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration is much ſtrengthened, by the preſence of the obiect in miſerie: this cauſed the poore Agar, abſent her ſelfe from her languishing ſonne, to disburden her ſelfe in ſome ſort of the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate griefe which she felt, ſaying: I will not ſee the child die; as contrariwiſe our Sauiour weepes, ſeeing the ſepulchre of his well-beloued Lazarus: and beholding his deare Hieruſalem; And the good IACOB, was ſtruck with griefe, when he ſaw the bloodie Robe of his poore little IOSEPH.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now, as many cauſes alſo doe augment complacence. As a friend is more deare vnto vs, we take more pleaſure in his contentment, and his good doth enter more deeply into our heart: which if it be excellent, our ioye is alſo greater; but if we ſee our friend while he enioyes it, our reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing becomes extreame. When the good IACOB knew that his ſonne liued, ô God what ioye! his heart returned home, he reuiued, yea as one would ſaie returned to life. But what is this, he reuiued, returned to life? THEO: SPIRITS die not their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per death but by ſinne, which ſeperateth them from God, who is their true ſupernaturall life, yet die they ſometimes by anothers death: and this happened to IAGOB, of whom we ſpeake: for loue which drawes into the heart of the louer, the good
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2765:170"/> and euill of the thing beloued, the one by compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the other by commiſeration, drew the death of the louely IOSEPH, into the louing IACOBS heart, and by a miracle impoſsible to any other power but loue, the minde of the good Father was full of the death of him that liued, and raigned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued affection forerunning the effect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But as ſoone as he had knowen that his ſonne was a liue, Loue who had ſo long detained the preſuppoſed death of the ſonne in the good Fathers heart ſeeing that he was deceiued, ſpeedely reiected this imaginarie death, and made enter in its place the true life of the ſaied ſonne; Thus then he returned to a new life, becauſe the life of his ſonne entred into his heart by complacence, and animated him with an incomparable contentment with which finding himſelfe ſatisfied, and not eſteeming any other pleaſure in compariſon of this, it fufficeth me, ſaieth he, if my child IOSEPH liue. But when with his proper eyes he experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his deare childs greateneſſe in Geſſan, hanging vpon him and for a good ſpace weeping about his necke; ah, now, ſaieth he, I will die ioyfull, my deare So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſith I haue ſeene thy face, and thou doſt yet liue. ô God what a ioye, THEO: and how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expreſſed by this old man! For what would he ſaie by theſe words, now I will die contented, ſith I haue ſeene thy face, but that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was ſo great that it was able to render death it ſelfe ioyfull and agreeable, being the moſt discomfortable, and horrible thing in the world? Tell me, I pray you, THEO: who hath more ſenſe of IOSEPHES good, he that enioyes it,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2765:171"/> or IACOB who reenioyes it? Certainly if good be not good but in reſpect of the content which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth vs: the father hath as much, yea more then the Sonne: for the ſonne together with the dignitie of VICE-ROY whereof he is poſſeſſed, hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently many cares, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d affaires: but the Father doth enioye by Complacence, and purely poſſeſſe all that good is, in this his ſonnes greateneſſe, and dignitie, without charge, care, or trouble. I will dye Ioyfull ſaieth he: Alas! who doth not ſee his contentment: if euen death cannot trouble his ioye, who can euer chang it? if his content can liue amidſt the diſtreſſes of death, who can euer bereeue him of it? Loue is ſtrong as death, and the ioyes of loue doe ſurmount the anoyes of death, for death ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not kill, but doth reuiue them, ſo that, as there is a fire which miraculouſly is feed in a fountaine nere Greenoble, as I ſurely know, and S. AVGVSTINE doth atteſt, ſo holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is ſo ſtrong, that she doth nourish her flames and conſolations in the ſaddeſt anguishes of death, and the waters of tribulations cannot extinguish her fires.</p>

                  </gap>SVS, ſaie I, who could haue borne theſe ſorrowes of death, in the ſoule of life, if not loue, who mouing commiſeration drew thereby our miſeries into thy ſoueraigne heart. Now a deuote ſoule, ſeeing this abiſſe of ſorrow and diſtreſſe in this Diuine louer, how can she be without a holily louing griefe? But conſidering on the other ſide, that none of theſe her well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued's afflictions proceede from any imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or want of force, but from the greatneſſe of his moſt deare loue she cannot but melt with a holily dolorous loue: ſo that she cries out, I am blacke with griefe by compaſſion, but I am faire with loue, by Complacence; the anguishes of my well-beloued, haue changed my hew; for how can a faithfull louer ſee him ſo tormented, whom she loues more then her life, without becomming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled, withered and dried vp with griefe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades tents, perpetually expoſed to the outrage of weather and warrs are almoſt ſtill beaten, and couered with duſt, and I open to ſorrows, which by commiſeration I receiue, from the exceſſiue ſuffrances of my diuine Sauiour, I am quite coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with anguishe, and ſplit with griefe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his griefes whom I loue, proceede from his loue, as much as they afflict me by compaſſion, they delight me by Complacence: For how muſt not a faithfull louer needes haue an extreme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſee her ſelfe ſo much beloued of her heauenly Spouſe! And hence the beautie of loue appears in the fouleneſſe of griefe. And though I weare mourning weedes for the Paſſion and death of my King, deformed and blacked with griefe, yet am
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2765:172"/> I not without an incomparable delight, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the exceſſe of his loue, amidſt the panges of his ſorrowes. And the tents of SALOMON bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and wrought with an incomparable diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of worke, was neuer ſo goodlie, as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and conſequently, ſweete, amiable, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, in the varietie of the eſſaies of loue, which I feele amongſt theſe griefes. Loue doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize the louers: ah! I ſee this deare louer, who is a burning fire, in a thornie bush of griefe; and euen ſo I, I am wholy inflamed with loue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the thornie thickets of ſorrow; I am a Lillie enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with thornes; doe not onely looke vpon the horrours of my pinching griefes, but behold the agreeable beautie of my loues. Alas this Diuine well-beloued louer doth ſuffer inſupportable griefes, this it is that toucheth my heart, and makes me ſound with anguish: but he takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuffering, he loues his torments, and dies with ioye, to die with griefe for me: wherefore as I greeue in his griefe, ſo am I rauished with ioye in his loue; I doe not onely ſorrow with him, but glorie in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was this loue THEO: that drew the Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats vpon the louing Seraphicall S. FRANCIS; and vpon the louing Angelicall S. CATHERINE of Scienna, the vrgent wounds of her Sauiour; the louing Complacence, hauing sharpened the point of the dolourous compaſſion, as honnie make the bitterneſſe of Wormewoode more pearcing and ſenſible: as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, the daintie ſmell of Roſes is refined by the neighberhoode of Garlike, which is planted neare the Roſe-trees: for ſo the louing
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2765:172"/> Complacence, which we haue taken in the loue of our Sauiour makes the compaſſion which we haue of his dolours more forcible; as alſo paſſing from the compaſſion of ſorrowes, to the complacence of loues, we take a more ardent, and high content. Then the griefe of loue, and the loue of griefe is practiſed; then the amourous compaſſion, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous complacence, as another ESAV and IACOB, ſtriuing who should ſtriue more, puts the ſoule into incredible conuultions and agonies, and as it were an extaſie amourously dolorous, and dolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly amourous. And according to this, the great ſoules of S. FRANCIS, and S. CATHERINE, felt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable loues: in their dolours, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe dolours in their loues, when they were ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, perceiuing loue ioyfull to endure for a friend, which our Sauiour exerciſed in the higheſt degree vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tree of the Croſſe. Thus is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vnion of our ſoule with God made, which as a myſticall Beniamin is a child of griefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be expreſſed, THEO: how much our Sauiour deſires to enter into our ſoules by way of this dolourous Complacence. Alas, ſaieth, he, open me the dore, my deare ſiſter, my friend, my doue, my all-faire, for my head is all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed, and my heires with the dropes of the night. What is this dewe, what are theſe dropes of the night, but the paines, and torments of his Paſsion? Pearles, (as we haue many times ſaied) are no other thing then dewie dropes, which the nights freshneſſe shewers downe vpon the face of the ſea, receiued in the shelles of Oyſters, or mother-pearles.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2765:173"/> Ah! would the diuine louer of the ſoule ſaie, I am! oden with the paines, and ſweat of my paſsion, which almoſt all paſſed either in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night, or in the night of darkneſſe, which the eclipſed ſunne cauſed at the hight of the day. Open then thy heart towards me, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-pearle doth hers towards heauen, and I will poure downe vpon thee, the dewe of my paſsion, which shall turne into pearles of conſolation.</p>

               <head>Of <hi>the Loue of Beneuolence</hi> which we exerciſe towards our Sauiour by way of deſire. <hi>CHAPTER. VI.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe loue which God exerciſeth towards vs, is alwayes begun by beneuolence willing and effecting all the good that is in vs, in which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he takes complacence. He made DAVID according to his heart by beneuolence, becauſe he found him according to his heart by Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. He firſt created the world for man and man in the world, indewing euery thing with ſuch a meaſure of goodneſſe as was proportionable to it out of his pure beneuolence; then he approued all that he had done, finding that all was very good, and by complacence repoſed in his worke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But contrariwiſe our loue towards God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins from the complacence which we haue in the ſoueraigne Goodneſſe, and infinite perfection,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2765:173"/> which we know is in the Diuinitie; then, we come to the exerciſe of beneuolence; And as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence which God takes in his creaturs, is no other thing then a continuation of his beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards them, ſo the beneuolence which we beare towards God, is nothing elſe, but an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and perſeuering in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now this loue of beneuolence towards God, is practiſed in this ſort: we cannot with a true deſire wish any good to God, becauſe his goodneſſe is infinitly more perfect, then we can either wish or thinke: Deſire is onely of a future good, and no good is future to God, ſith that all good is ſo preſent to him, that the preſence of good in his Diuine Maieſtie, is no other thing then the Diuinitie it ſelfe. Not hauing therefore power to make an abſolute deſire for God, we doe make imaginarie and conditionall ones, in this manner: I haue ſaied, ô Lord thou art my God, who being full of thy owne infinite goodneſſe, can haue no wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, neither of my riches, nor of any other thing: but if by imagination of a thing impoſsible, I could thinke, thou had'ſt neede of any thing, I would neuer ceaſe to wish it thee, euen with the loſſe of my life, beeing, and of all that the world hath. And if being what thou art, and which thou cannot but ſtill be, it were poſsible that thou couldſt receiue any encreaſe of good, ô God, what a deſire should I haue, that thou hadſt it: In that caſe ô eternall Lord, I would deſire to ſee my heart conuerted into wishes, and my life into ſighes, to wish thee ſuch a good: ah! yet would I not for all this, ô thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2765:174"/> well-beloued of my ſoule, deſire to haue power to deſire any good to thy Maieſtie; yea I hartily pleaſe my ſelfe in this thy ſupreeme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of goodneſſe, to which nothing can be added, neither by deſire, nor yet by thought. But if ſuch a deſire were poſsible, ô infinte, Diuinitie, ô Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine infinitie, my ſoule would be that deſire, and no other thing then that, ſo much would she be deſirous, to deſire for thee, that which she is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly pleaſed, that she cannot deſire, ſeeing that her impotencie therein proceedes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infinite infinitie of thy perfection, which outſtrips all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and cogitation. Ah! ô my God how dearly I loue the impoſsibilitie of being able to deſire thee any good, ſith, that ryſeth out of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible immenſitie of thy abundance, which is ſo ſoueraignely infinite, that if there be an infinite deſire, it should be infinitly ſaciated by the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thy Goodneſſe, which would conuert it into an infinite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placence. Theſe deſires then by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of impoſſibilities, may be ſometimes profitably practiſed, amongſt great, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie feelings and feruours. Thus, as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did the great S. AVGVSTINE often behaue himſelfe pouring out in exceſſe of loue, in theſe words. Ah! Lord, I am AVGVSTINE, and thou art God, but howbeit, if that which neither is, nor can be, were, that I were God, and thou AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE, I would, in changing my condition with thee, become AVGVSTINE, to the end, thou mighteſt be God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is another kind of Beneuolence towards God, when ſeeing we cannot aduance him in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2765:174"/> we ſtriue to doe it in our ſelues, that is ſtill more and more to encreaſe the Complacence we take in his Goodneſſe. And then THEOT: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not the Complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the pleaſure it yealdes vs, but purely becauſe this pleaſure is in God: For as we deſire not the compaſsion, for the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it brings to our heart, but becauſe this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row doth vnite, and aſſociate vs to our well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued who greerueth; Nor doe we loue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence becauſe it brings vs pleaſure, but becauſe this pleaſure is taken in vnion of the pleaſure, and goodneſſe which is in God, to which to be more vnited, we would pleaſe our ſelues in a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence infinitly greater, by the imagination of the moſt holy Queene, and mother of loue, whoſe ſoule did continually magnifie and exalte God; And to th'end that it might be knowen that this aduancement was made by the complacence which she tooke in the diuine Goodneſſe, she ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that her heart leapt with contentment in God her Sauiour.</p>

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2765:175"/> which we take in the Diuine Goodneſſe and to effect this encreaſe, the ſoule doth carefully depriue her ſelfe of all other pleaſure, that she may giue herſelfe more entirely to take pleaſure in God. A religious man, asked S. GILES, one of the firſt, and moſt holy Companions of S. FRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIS in what worke he could be moſt agreeable to God: he anſwered, in ſinging one to one, which after explicating; giue alwayes, quoth he, all your ſoule, the onely one to God, who is one. The ſoule doth glide through pleaſures, and the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of them doth diſtract and hinder her, that she cannot attentiuely attend to the pleaſure which she ought to take in God. The true Louer hath ſcarcely any pleaſure, but in the thing beloued. The glorious S. PAVLE reputed all things as durt or dung, in compariſon of his Sauiour. And the ſacred Spouſe is entirely for her well-beloued. And if the ſoule that ſtands thus holily affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, meet with creaturs neuer ſo excellent, yea though they were Angels, she makes no delay with them, ſaue onely to be helped and aduanced in her deſire. Tell me then, ſaieth she to them, tell me I coniure you: haue you not ſeene him, whom my heart loues? The glorious Louer MAGDELEN met the Angels at the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, who doubtleſſe ſpoke to her angelically, that is, deliciouſly, deſirous to appeaſe her griefe, but contrariwiſe, wholy ruthfull, she could take no kind of content, neither in their milde words, nor in the glorie of their garments, nor in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly grace of their geſture, nor in the wholy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely beautie of their featurs, but couered with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2765:175"/> tears, they haue taken away my Maiſter, ſaieth she, and I know not where they haue put him. And turning about she ſaw her ſweete Sauiour, but in forme of a Gardener, wherein her heart ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at repoſe: for full with the loue of the death of her maiſter; flowres she will haue none, nor conſequently Gardeners; she hath with in her heart the croſſe, the nailes, the thornes, she ſeakes her crucified Lord: ah my deare Maiſter Gardener, ſaieth she, whether peraduenture haue you not planted my well-beloued deſeaſed Lord, amongſt your flowres as a Lillie, cruſshed and withered? Tell me quickly, and I will carrie him away. But no ſooner had he called her by her name, but wholy melting with delight. ô God, ſaieth she, maiſter! Nothing can content her, nor Angels co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie delight he, no nor yet her Sauiours, vnleſſe he appeare, in that forme in which he had ſtolne her heart. The kings could not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, neither in Hieruſalems goodlineſſe, nor in the Courts magnificence, nor in the ſtarres ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour: Their hearts ſearching the little caue and child of Bethleem. The MOTHER OF FAIRE DILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTION, and the Spouſe of moſt holy Loue, cannot ſtay amongſt their parents and friends, they ſtill walke on in griefe, enquiring after the onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of their delight: The deſire to encreaſe holy complacence, cuts of all other pleaſure, to th'end it may with more feruour practiſe that, to which diuine beneuolence doth excite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, more to magnifie the ſoueraigne well-beloued, the ſoule goes ſtill purſuing his face, that is, with an attention daily more carefull and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2765:176"/> she notes euery particularitie of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perfections which are in him, making a continuall progreſſe in this pleaſing inquirie of motiues, that might perpetually preſſe her to a greater complacence in the incomprehenſible goodneſſe which she loueth. So DAVID, in many of his heauenly Pſalmes, doth cote by parcells the workes and wonders of God. And the ſacred Spouſe, rangeth in her diuine Canticles as a well ranked armie, all the perfections of her ſpouſe in their order, to prouoke her ſoule, to a holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, thereby more highly to magnifie his excellencie, and withall to winne euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the loue of her ſo louely a friend.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2765:177"/> wish to haue infinite praiſes to beſtowe vpon her well-beloued, becauſe she finds his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections more then infinite: ſo that finding her ſelfe to fall farre short of her aime, she addes force to her affection, to praiſe, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, this moſt praiſeworthy goodneſſe, and theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours of Beneuolence, are meruellouſly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by complacence: for according as the ſoule finds God good, taſting more and more his ſweeteneſſe and taking complacence in his infinit goodneſſe, she would alſo raiſe higher his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and praiſes. And againe, as the ſoule wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hote, in praiſing the incomprehenſible ſweeteneſſe of her God, she enlargeth and dilateth the complacence she takes in him; and by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t she doth animate her ſelfe more earneſtly to praiſe him. So that the affection of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and that of praiſe, by their reciprocall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and incitements, doe aduance one another with great and continuall encreaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So Nightingales, according to Plinie, takes ſuch complacence in their ſonges, that by reaſon of this complacence, for fiue dayes and fiue nightes long, they neuer leaue warbling, forcing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſing better, in despight one of the other; ſo that when they chirpe the beſt, thy take a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complacence, and this encreaſe of complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, carrieth them to force themſelues to a better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, augmenting in ſuch ſort their complace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by their ſonge, and their ſonge by their compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that often they are ſeene to fall downe dead ſpliting their weeſeells with the violence of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Birdes worthy the faire name of Philomele,

               <p n="5">5. O God, THEOT: how the ſoule ardently preſſed with affection to praiſe God, is touched with a dolour, greatly delicious, and a delight greatly dolorous, when after a thouſand eſſaies of praiſes, she finds herſelfe to come short: Alas! this poore Nightingale ſtriues ſtill to lance out her accents higher, and perfect her melodie, the better to ſing the praiſes of her well-beloued. By how much more she praiſeth, by ſo much she is more delighted in praiſing; and by how much greater her delight in praiſing is, by ſo much her diſpleaſure is greater, that she cannot yet more praiſe him; and yet to find what content she can in this paſsion, she vſeth all endeauours, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt them falls in languishment, as it happened to the moſt glorious S. FRANCIS, who in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he had to praiſe God, and ſing his Canticles of loue, shed a great abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of teares, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d through faintneſſe, let often fall what at ſuch times he had in his hands: remaining in languishment, as a ſacred Philomele, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eftſones loſt breath, in breathing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his praiſes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could neuer praiſe ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But marke a fine ſimilitude vpon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, drawen from the name which this louing ſaint gaue his religious; for he called them Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, by reaſon of the nightly praiſes they ſunge to God. Cygales, THEO: haue their breaſts ſet with pipes, as though they were naturall orgaines; and to ſing the better they liue onely of dewe, which they take not by the beake for they haue none, but ſucke it by a certaine weeſel they haue in

Now this is the ſtate of the ſacred Louer; for all the faculties of her ſoule are as ſo many pipes which she hath in her breaſt, to reſound the well-beloued's Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticles a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d praiſes.

THe heart that is taken and preſſed with a deſire of praiſing the Diuine Goodneſſe more then it is able, after many endeauours, goes often times out of it ſelfe to inuite all Creaturs to helpe it in it's deſigne. As did the three children in the furnace, in that admirable Canticle of Benedictions, by which they excite all that is in Heauen, in earth and vnder the earth to render thankes to the Eternall God, in Bleſsing and praiſing him ſoueraignely: as alſo the glorious Pſalmiſt, wholy moued by a holily irregular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to praiſe God, goes without order leaping from heauen to earth, from thence to heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, inuoking pel-mel, Angels, fishes, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Waters, Dragons, Birdes, Serpents, Fire, Haile, Fogges, aſſembling by his deſires all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs; to th'end that they all might conſpire piouſly to magnifie their Creatour.

So the heauenly Spouſe perceiuing her ſelfe almoſt to ſound amidſt the violent eſſaies she vſed in bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and magnifying the well-beloued king of her heart; ah! cried she out to her companions; the diuine Spouſe, hath led me by contemplation into his wine-celler, making me taſte the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable delightes of the perfections of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,

And voices which doe all accord in one to ſing the ioyfull Paſcall Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticle ALLELVIA, praiſe God, Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiſe God: for know, THEO: that there is a voice heard from the diuine Throne, which ceaſeth not to crie to the happie inhabitants of the glorious heauenly Hieruſalem, Praiſe God ô you that are his ſeruants, and you that feare him great and little, at which all the innumerable multitude of Saints, the quires of Angels, and men with one conſent, doe anſwere in ſinging with all their force.

But what is this admirable voice, which iſſuing out from the diuine Throne, doth announce the ALLELVIAS to the Elect, if not the moſt holy complacence, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the heart makes them feele the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Diuine perfections, wherevpon a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beneuolence, the ſource of heauenly praiſes, is bred in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that complacence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from the Throne, intimateth Gods greatneſſe to the Bleſſed, and beneuolence excites them mutually to pouer out the odours of praiſe before the Throne.

               <p n="2">2. Being two yeares agoe at Milan, whither the veneration of the fresh memorie of the great Archbishope S. CHARLES had drawen me, with certaine of our Church-men, we heard in diuers Churches, diuers ſorts of muſike: but in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Nunnes, we heard a Religious woman whoſe voice was ſo admirably delicious, that she alone, filled our minds with more delight incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably then all the reſt together, which though otherwiſe excellent, yet ſeemed they to ſerue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue luſter, and raiſe the perfection and grace
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2765:183"/> of this ſingular voice. So, THEO: amongſt all the Quires of men and Angels, the moſt ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine's loftie voice is heard, which raiſed aboue all, renders more praiſe to God, then doe all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creaturs. And indeede the Heauenly king inuites her to ſing, in a particular manner: shew me thy face, ſaieth he, my well-beloued, let thy voice ſound in my eares, for thy voice is entirely ſweete and thy face wholy faire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the praiſes which this Mother of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and faire dilection together with all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs giues to the Diuinitie, though excellent and admirable, come yet ſo short of the infinite merite of Gods goodneſſe, that they carrie no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it: and therefore, albeit they meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly pleaſe the louing heart's holy beneuolence to the well-beloued, yet doe they not ſaciate it. Wherefore it goes forward and inuites our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour to praiſe and glorifie his eternall Father, with all the Benedictions which a Sonnes loue can fournish him withall. And then, THEO: the ſoule is put to ſilence, being able onely to admire. O what a Canticle is this of the Sonne to his Father! ô how faire this deare well-beloued is amongſt all the children of men! ô how ſweete is his voice, as iſſuing from the lipps vpon which the fulneſſe of grace was poured! All the others are perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but he is the perfume it ſelfe; the others are embaumed, but he is Baulme poured out: the eternall receiues others praiſes, as ſmells of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar flowres, but vpon the odour of the praiſes which our Sauiour giues him, doubtleſſe he cries out: ô theſe are the odours of my ſonns praiſes,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2765:183"/> as the odour of a field full of flowres which I haue bleſſed! I, my deare THEO: all the Benedictions which the Church militant and triumphant offers to God, are Angelicall and humane benedictions; for beit, they are addreſſed to the Creatour, yet proceede they from a Creature: but the Sonns, are diuine, for they doe not onely tend to God, as the others, but they flow from God; the Redeemour being true God, they are not onely diuine in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their end, but of their beginning: diuine, becauſe they tend to God; diuine, becauſe they iſſue from God. God prouokes the ſoule, endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with ſufficient grace for the production of other praiſes; But the Redeemour, being God, produceth his owne, himſelfe, and thence they are infinite.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that in a morning for a good ſpace ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard in the neighbour woods the ſweete chaunting of a great companie of Canarie birdes, Linnets, Goldfinches, and ſuch like little birdes, should in the end heare a Maiſter Nightingale, who in perfect melodie, would fill the aire, and eare with her admirable voice, doubtleſſe he would preferre this one grouie Chaunter, before the whole Quires of the others. So hauing heard all the praiſes which ſo many different ſorts of of creaturs, in emulation of one another, renders vnanimouſly to their Creatour, when at length one markes that of our Sauiour, they find in it a certaine infinitie of merite, valour, ſweeteneſſe, which paſſe all hope, and expectation of heart: and the ſoule, as awaked out of a deepe ſleepe, is then ſodenly rauished with extreamitie of the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

See how this deare friend doth ſpring out, ſee how he comes tripping ouer the mountaines, tranſcending the hills: his voice is heard aboue the Seraphins and all other creaturs; he hath the ſight of a Goate, to penetrate deeper then any other, the beautie of the Sacred obiect which he deſires to praiſe. He loues the melodie of the glorie, and praiſe of his Father, more then all the reſt, and therefore he takes his Fathers praiſes, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in a ſtraine aboue them all.

For Good God, if we could ſee him, as he is, we should die of Loue for him, being we are mortalls, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

               <p n="1">1. All our Sauiours humane actions are of an infinite merite and value, by reaſon of the perſon which doth produce them, which is the ſame God with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, yet are they not infinite by nature and eſſence. For as being in a Chamber, we receiue not light with proportion to the Sonns brightneſſe, which ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes it out, but according to the greatneſſe of the window, by which it is communicated; ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours humane actions, are not infinite, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they be of infinite value; foralbeit they are the actions of a diuine Perſon, yet are they not produced according to the extent of his infinitie, but accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the finite greatneſſe of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by which they are produced. So that, as the humane actions of our ſweete Sauiour, are infinite compared to ours, ſo are they onely finite in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the eſſentiall infinitie of the Diuinitie. They are infinite in value, eſtimation, and dignitie as proceeding from a perſon which is God; yet are they finite by nature and eſſence, as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of God according to his humane nature and ſubſtance, which is finite, and therefore the praiſes which are giuen by our Sauiour, as he is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2765:185"/> man, not being in all reſpects infinite cannot fully correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the infinite greatneſſe of the Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to which they are directed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherefore after the firſt rauishment of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration which doth take vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we meete with a praiſe ſo glorious, as is that which our Sauiour renders to his Father, we leaue, not to auowe, that the Diuinitie is yet infinitly more praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can be praiſed, either by all the creaturs, or by the very humanitie of the eternall Sonne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If one did praiſe the Sunne for its light, the more he should ſet a praiſing it, the more he should find it praiſe-worthy, becauſe he should ſtill diſcouer more and more brightneſſe. And if as it is very probable, it be the beautie of this light, which prouoketh the Larke to ſinge, it is not ſtrang that as she flies more loftily, she ſings more clearely, equally raiſing her voice and her flight, till ſuch time as heardly being able so ſing any more, she begins to fall in voice and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſtouping by little and little, as from her winge, ſo in her voice. So THEO: as we mount nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto the Diuinitie by Beneuolence to intone and heare the praiſes thereof, we diſcouer more clearely, that his praiſe is ſtill aboue our notes. And finally, we learne that it cannot be praiſed according to the worth ſaue onely by it ſelfe, which alone can fit its ſoueraigne goodneſſe with a ſoueraigne praiſe. Herevpon we crie out, GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE BE VNTO THE FATHER, AND THE SONNE, AND TO THE HOLY GHOST: and that euery one may know that it is not the glorie of created praiſes, which we wish should be giuen to God,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2765:186"/> by this eiaculation, but the eſſentiall and eternall glorie that is in himſelfe, by himſelfe, of himſelfe, and which is himſelfe, we adde; as it was in the begining, ſo now, and shall be for euer and euer AM<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>N: As though we should wish; That God should be glorified for euer, with the glorie which he had before all creaturs, in his infinit eternitie, and eternall infinitie. To this purpoſe we conclud euery Pſalme and Canticle with this verſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the auncient cuſtome of the Eaſterne Church, which the great S. HIEROME, ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Pope Damaſus, that he would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe it here in the weſt to proteſt, that all the praiſes of men and Angels, are too low, to reach home to the Diuine Bounties praiſe: and that to be worthily praiſed, he himſelfe is to be his owne glorie, praiſe, and benediction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. O God what a Complacence, what a ioye shall it be to the ſoule to haue her deſire fulfilled, in ſeeing her Beloued infinitly praiſe, bleſſe and magnifie himſelfe! But from this Complacence there ſprings a new deſire of praiſe: for the ſoule would gladly praiſe this ſo worthy a praiſe giuen to God by himſelfe, rendring him heartie thankes for it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d inuoking againe all things to her ſuccour to come and glorifie the glorie of God with her, to bleſſe his infinit bleſsings, and praiſe his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall praiſes, ſo that by this repetition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling praiſes vpon praiſes, she engageth her ſelfe betwixt Complacence and Beneuolence, in a moſt happie Labirinth of loue being wholy drunk vp and drowned in this immenſe ſweeteneſſe, ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely praiſing the Diuinitie, in that, that it
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2765:186"/> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſufficiently be praiſed but by it ſelfe. And though in the beginning the ſoule in loue had conceiued a certaine deſire of praiſing God ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently; yet reflecting vpon her ſelfe againe, she proteſts that she would not wish to haue power to praiſe him ſufficiently, but remaines in a moſt humble Complacence, to perceiue that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Goodneſſe is ſo infinitly praiſe-worthy, that it cannot be ſufficiently praiſed, ſaue by its owne infinitie onely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And here, the ſoule rauished with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſings the ſong of ſacred ſilence.

               <p n="2">2. The firſt exerciſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth, in Praier ſpecially in which ſo many different inward motions paſſe, that to expreſſe them all is impoſsible, not onely by reaſon of their number but alſo for their nature and qualitie, which being ſpirituall, they cannot but be very ſecret, and almoſt hid from our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the moſt trained and beſt ſented hounds, are often at default, looſing the ſtraine and ſent by the varietie of ſleights which the Hart vſeth, by dubles making them rune riot, and practiſing a thouſand shiftes to eſcape the Crie: and we often times looſe the ſent and knowledge of our owne heart in the infinite diuerſitie of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which it doth turne it ſelfe into ſo many formes, and that with ſuch promptitude, that one cannot diſcerne the footings thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God alone is he, who by his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſees, ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and penetrats all the turnings a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d windings of our hearts, he a farre of vnderſtands our thoughts, finds out our traces, our doubles

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we would looke backe vpon our owne hearts by the reflections and turnings of their actions, we should light into Labyrinthes, wherein we should find no out-gate, and it would require an intolerable atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, to thinke what our thoughtes are, to conſider our conſiderations, to ſee all our ſpirituall ſightes, to diſcerne that we diſcerne, to remember that we remember; theſe would be Mazes out of which we should not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer our ſelues. This treatiſe then is moſt hard, eſpecially to one not greatly conuerſant in praiere.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We take not here the word PRAIER for the onely praier, or demaund of any good thing, pouered out by the faithfull before God, as S. BASILE calles it, but with S. BONAVENTVRE ſaying that Praier, generally ſpeaking, comprehendes all the acts of contemplation; or with S. GRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GORIE Niſſene, teaching that praier is an entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, or conuerſation of the ſoule with God; or elſe with S. CHRYSOSTOME, aſſuring vs that Praier is a diſcourſe with the diuine Mageſtie; or finally with S. AVGVSTINE, and S. DAMASCENE, terming Praier an aſcent or raiſing of the ſoule to God. And if Praier be a ſpeach, diſcourſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of the ſoule with God, by it then we ſpeake to God and he againe ſpeakes to vs; we aſpire to him, and repoſe in him, and he mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inſpires vs, and repoſeth in vs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But of what doe we diſcourſe in Praier, what is the ſubiect of our entertainement? THEO: we ſpeake of God onely: for of what can Loue
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2765:189"/> diſcourſe and talke, but of the well-beloued? and therefore Praier, and myſticall Diuinitie are one ſame thing. It is called Diuinitie, becauſe as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatiue Diuinitie, hath God for its obiect, ſo this ſpeakes onely of God, yet with three differences: for 1. that, treates of God, as God; but this ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of God, as ſoueraignely amiable; that is, that aimes at the Diuinitie of the ſupreame Goodneſſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this at the ſupreame Goodneſſe of the Diuinitie 2. the ſpeculatiue treats of God with men and amongſt men; the myſticall ſpeakes of God, with God, and in God himſelfe. 3. the Speculatiue tends to the knowledge of God; and the myſticall to the loue of God; ſo that, that makes her ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers knowing, learned, and Diuins; but this makes hers become ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and affectionate louers of God, and PHILOTHEES, OR THEOPHILES.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now it is called myſticall, for that its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is altogether ſecrete, and there is nothing ſaied in it betwixt God and the ſoule, ſaue onely from heart to heart by a communication in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to all, but themſelues. Louers language is ſo particular to them ſelues, that none but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnderſtand ir. I ſleepe, ſaied the holy Spouſe and my heart watcheth. Ah, harke how my well-beloued ſpeakes vnto me. Who would haue geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that this Spouſe being a ſleepe, could yet talke with her Spouſe? but where loue raignes, the noiſe of exteriour words is not neceſſarie, nor the helpe of ſenſe to entertaine and mutually to heare one another. In fine Praier, and myſticall Diuinitie is no other thing, then a conuerſation, in which the ſoule doth louingly diſcourſe with God, touching
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2765:189"/> his moſt amiable goodneſſe to be vnited and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Praier is a Manna in regard of the infinitie of amiable taſtes, and precious delightes, which it giues to ſuch as vſe it: but it is ſecrete, becauſe it falls before the light of any ſcience in the MEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALL SOLITVDE where one onely ſoule, treates with one onely God. What is she this, might one ſaie of her, who aſcends though the Deſert as a cloud of perfumes, of Mirrhe, of incenſe, and of all the pouders of Perfumers: and indeede it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſecrecie that moued her to make this peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her Spouſe: come my well-beloued, let's goe into the fieldes, let vs ſoiourne in the village: for this reaſon the heauenly ſpouſe, is ſtiled Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a birde which is delighted in shadie and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie places, where she makes no other vſe of her voice, but for her deare mate, ether in life wooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or after his death plaining him. For this reſpect in the Canticles, the diuine Spouſe, and the heauenly Spouſe repreſent their loues in a continuall diſcourſe, and if their friends, men and women, doe ſometimes ſpeake in it, t'is onely by the by, without interrupting their ſpeach. Hence the Bleſſed mother S. TERESA of IESVS, found in the beginning more profit, in the miſteries where our Sauiour was moſt alone, as in the Garden of Oliuet, and where he expected the Samaritaine; for she thought, he being alone, would with more eaſe admitt her into his companie.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Loue loues to be ſecret, yea though Louers haue no ſecret to impart, yet are they delighted in ſpeaking ſecretly; and it is partly, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2765:190"/> becauſe they will ſpeake onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; nor doe they thinke to ſpeake to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely while they ſpeake high; partly for that they doe not deliuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon things in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, but by particular wayes, and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the affection, with which they are ſpoken. Loue language for the words is comon; yet in manner, and pronounciation is ſo particular, that none but Louers vnderſtand it. The name of a Friend vttered in common, is no great thing; but being ſpoken a part, ſecretly in the eare, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports wonders. And by how much more ſecretly it is ſpoken, the ſignification is ſo much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.

So diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alwayes dreaming a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d buſying themſelues in vnprofitable thoughtes, without knowing in a manner what they thinke vpon; and which is admirable, they are onely attentiue for want of attention, and would be rid of ſuch thoughtes. Wittneſſe he that ſaied: my thoughtes waſte themſelues, tormenting my heart. Others there are that ſtudie, and by a moſt laborious trade, fill themſelues with vanitie, not being able
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2765:191"/> to withſtand curioſitie. But few there are, that meditate, to kindle their heart with heauenly loue. In fine, thoughtes, and ſtudies may be vpon any ſubiect, but meditation in our preſent ſenſe, hath reference onely to thoſe obiectes, whoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration tend's to make vs good and deuote. So that meditation is an attentiue thought iterated, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily intertained in the mynd,, to excitate the will to holy affections and reſolutions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Verily the holy word, doth admirably well explicate by an excellent ſimilitude wherin holy meditation conſiſteth. Ezechias when he would explicate in his Canticle, the attentiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he had of his annoyes: I will crie, ſaieth he, like a young ſwallow, and meditate as a doue: for, my deare THEO: if euer you tooke notice of it, the younge ſwallows doe gape wide in their chirping; and contrariwiſe, the doue, of all the birdes, doth murmur with her neb shut and clos'd, rowling her voice in her weeſell and and crope, nothing paſsing outwardly but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſounding or eccho-like ſound, and this cloſe murmuring, doth equally ſerue her in the expreſsion of her griefe and loues. Ezechias then to shew, that in his calamitie, he made many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Praiers; I will crie, ſaieth he, as a younge ſwallow, opening my mouth, to lay before God in many lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table voices; and to teſtifie alſo that he made vſe of holy mentall prayer, he addes, I will meditate, as a doue winding and doubling my thoughtes within my heart, by an attentiue conſideration, to excite my ſelfe to bliſſe and praiſe the ſoueraigne mercy of my God, who hath
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2765:192"/> brought me backe from deaths gate, taking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of my miſerie. So, ſaieth Iſaie, we will roare or ruſtle like Beares, and meditating we will mourne as Doues, the ruſtling of Beares doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the exclamations which are made in vocall praier, and the mourning of Doues, is compared to holy meditation. But to the end it may appeare that Doues doe not onely mourne in occaſions of griefe, but euen of loue alſo and ioye, the ſacred Spouſe deſcribing the naturall ſpring-time, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the graces of the ſpirituall ſpring-time: the Turtles voice, ſaieth he, hath bene heard in our land, becauſe in the ſpring the Turtle begins to waxe hote with loue; which by her more frequent ſong she teſtifieth: and preſently after, my Doue shew me thy face, let thy voice reſound in my eares; for thy voice is ſweete, and thy face comely and gracious. He would ſaie THEO: that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote ſoule is moſt agreeable vnto him, when she preſents her ſelfe before him, and meditats to heate her ſelfe in holy ſpirituall loue, as doe Doues to ſtirre vp their mates to a naturall loue. So he that had ſaied, I will meditate as a Doue, putting his conceite into other words: I will recall to mind, ſaieth he, all my yeares in the bitterneſſe of my ſoule: for to meditate, and to recall to mind to th'end to moue affection, are the ſame thing. Hence Moyſes exhorting the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to mind the benefits receiued of God, he addes this reaſon, to th'end you may obſerue his commandements, walke in his wayes, and feare him. And our Sauiour himſelfe gaue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Ioſue: thou shalt meditate in the booke
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2765:192"/> of the lawe, day and night, that therby thou mayeſt obſerue and doe that which is written in it; which in one of the paſſages, is expreſſed by the word MEDITATE, is declared in the other, by RECALL TO MIND. And to shew that an iterated thought, and meditation, tend to moue vs to affections, reſolutions, and act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons; it is ſaied as well in the one as the other paſſage, that we muſt recall to mind, and meditate in the law, to obſerue and practiſe it. In this ſenſe the Apoſtle exhorts vs ſaying think diligently vpon him who ſuſtained of ſinners ſuch contradiction againſt himſelfe, that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds. When he ſaieth think diligently, it is as though he had ſaied, meditate: but why would he haue vs to meditate: the holy paſsion? not that we should waxe learned, but that we should become patient, and conſtant in the way of heauen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Meditation is a myſticall ruminating (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that we might not be found vncleane,) to which one of the pious shepherdeſſes that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſacred Sunamite inuits vs; for she aſſures vs that holy write, is as a precious wine, worthy to be drunk, not onely by the Paſtours and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, but alſo to be diligently taſted, chewed and ruminated, as one would ſaie: Thy throte, ſaieth she, wherein the holy words are formed, is a beſt wine worthy of my well-beloued, to be drunk with his lippes, and ruminated with his teeth. So the Bleſſed Iſaac, as a neate and pure Lambe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night went out into the fields, to recollect, conferre, and exerciſe his Spirit with God, that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2765:193"/> is, to praie and meditate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Bee flies from flowre to flowre in the ſpring time, not at all adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures, but of pourpoſe; not to be recreated onely in the verdant diapring of the fieldes, but to gather honie, which hauing found, she ſuckes, and lodes her ſelfe with it, thence carying it to her hyue, she accommodates it artificially, ſeparating the waxe from it, therof makeing the combe to reſerue honie for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing winter. Such is the deuote ſoule in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: she paſſeth from myſterie to myſterie, not at randome, or to ſolace her ſelfe onely in viewing the admirable beautie of thoſe diuine obiectes, but deliberatly and of ſet pourpoſe, to find out motifes of loue, or ſome heauenly affection; and hauing found them, she drawes them to her, she relisheth them and lodes her ſelfe with them, and hauing brought them home, and placed them in her heart, she ſelectes that which she finds moſt proper for her aduancement, ſtoring herſelfe with fit reſolutions againſt the time of temptation. Thus the celeſtiall Spouſe, as a myſticall bee, flies to the Canticle of Canticles, now vpon the eyes, now vpon the lippes, cheekes and head haire of the well-beloued, to draw from thence the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a thouſand paſsions of loue; to this effect, noting in particular whatſoeuer she finds rare. So that inflamed with holy loue, she ſpeakes with him, puts interrogatories to him; she harkes ſighes, aſpires, admires; as he of his part fills her with delight, inſpiring her, touching and opening her heart, and ſtreaming into it brightneſſe, lighte and ſweeteneſſes with-out end, but in ſo ſecrete a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2765:193"/> manner, that one may rightly ſaie of this holy conuerſation of the ſoule with God, as the Holy Text ſaieth of God's with Moiſes: that Moiſes being ſole vpon the tope of the mountaine, he ſpoke to God, and God anſwered him.</p>

The little younge Bees, are called nymphes vntill they make honie, and then they become Bees: ſo praier is named meditation, till ſuch time as it haue produced the honie of deuotion, and then it is conuerted into contemplation: for as the Bee flies through the countrie meades, to prey here and there, and gather honie, which hauing heaped together, she takes in its ſweetneſſe: ſo we meditate, to gather the loue of God; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gathered it, we contemplate God, and are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentife to his Goodneſſe, by reaſon of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which loue makes vs find in it: The deſire we haue to obtaine diuine loue, makes vs medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, but loue obtained, makes vs contemplate:
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2765:194"/> for by loue we find out a ſweeteneſſe ſo agreeable in the thing beloued, that we cannot ſatisfie our mindes in ſeeing and conſidering it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behould the Queene of Saba THEO: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering by parcells the wiſdome of Salomon in his anſwers, in the beautie of his houſe, in the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficencie of his table, in his ſeruants lodgings, in the order that his Courtiours held in executing their charges, in their apparrell, and behauiour, in the multitude of Holocauſts which were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Temple, she was taken with an ardent loue, which changed her meditation into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, by which being rapt out of her ſelfe, she vttered diuers words of extreame conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment. The ſight of ſo many wonders begot in her heart an exceeding loue, and that loue enkindled a new deſire to ſee ſtill more, and enioye his preſence with whom she ſaw them, whence she cried. O how happie are the ſeruants, who are ſtill about thee, and heare thy wiſedome! In like manner, we ſometimes begin to eate to get an appetite; but our appetite being egged, we continue eating to content it. And in the beginning we conſider the Goodneſſe of God to excite our wills to loue him; but loue being formed in our hearts, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſame Goodneſſe to content our loue, which cannot be ſatiated in ſeeing continually what it loues. In concluſion, meditation is the mother of loue, but contemplation is her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and for this reaſon I called contemplation a louing attention; for childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are named after their Father, and not the Father after the child.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true, THEO: that as the auncient IOSEPH,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2765:194"/> who was the crowne and Glorie of his Father, did greatly encreaſe his honours and contentment and made him waxe young in his old age, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation doth crowne its Father, which is loue, perfectes him, and giues him the tope of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie: for loue hauing moued in vs a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue attention, that attention breedes reciprocally a more great and feruent loue, which in the end is crowned with perfections, when it enioyes the thing beloued. Loue makes vs take pleaſure in in the ſight of our well-beloued, and the ſight of our well-beloued makes vs take pleaſure in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue: ſo that by this mutuall motion of loue to the ſight, and ſight to loue, as loue renders the beautie of the thing beloued more beautifull, ſo the ſight of it makes loue more louely and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Loue by an imperceptible power, makes the beautie which we loue appeare more faire, and ſight likewiſe doth refine loue to make it finde beautie more amiable. Loue moues the eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to behold the beloued beautie more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely, and the ſight doth force the heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to loue it more forcibly.</p>

DENIS, doth often repeate that loue penetrates, where exteriour knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach; and ſaieth that many Bishops though not very learned, had penetrated the myſterie of the Trinitie, admiring vpon this paſſage his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler S. ANTONIE of Padua, who without wordly knowledge was endowed with a profound myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Diuinitie, who as another S. IOHN Baptiſte, one might haue called, a light and burning lampe. The Bleſſed Brother Gilles, one of the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of S. FRANCIS, ſaied one day to S. BONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTVRE, ô how happie you learned men are, for you vnderſtand many things, wherby you praiſe God: but what can we Idiotes doe? S.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2765:195"/> man loue God, as well as a learned? yes, ſaieth S.

               <p n="3">3. The will perceiues not Good, but by meanes of the vnderſtanding, but hauing once perceiued it, She hath no more neede of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to practiſe loue; for the force of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which she feeleth or pretends to feele by being vnited to her obiect, drawes her powerfully to loue, and to a deſire to enioye it: ſo that the knowledge of good, breedes loue, but bounds it not: as we ſee the knowledge of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, moues coler, which if it be not ſuppreſſed doth in a manner alwayes exceede the wronge.

We begin our loue by the knowledge which faith giues vs of God's Goodneſſe, which afterwards we relish and taſte by loue, and loue eggeth our guſt, and our guſt refines our loue, ſo that as we ſee the water role and ſwell by the windes blaſtes, as by emulation vpon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, ſo the taſte of good doth warme loue, and loue againe the taſte, according to that Oracle of the diuine wiſdome.

While chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue not yet taſted honie and ſuggar, it is heard to make them receiue them into their mouthes: but after they haue o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce felt their ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they doe more affect them then one would wishe: ſtill crying for them without meaſure.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We muſt confeſſe notwitſtanding that the will drawen by the delight which she takes in her obiect, is more forcibly carried to be vnited to it, when the vnderſtanding of his ſide, doth in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner propoſe vnto her the goodneſſe thereof; for she is then at once both drawen and thruſt forward; thruſt by knowledge, drawen by delight, ſo that knowledge is not of it ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, but profitable to deuotion, and meeting together, they doe meruellouſly aſsiſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though it often happens through our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that knowledge doth impeach the birth of deuotion, for ſo much as knowledge doth make

One may behold, the beautie of a rich crowne two wayes, ether in looking vpon all the flowers and precious ſtones wherwith it is wrought and beſett, or els after the conſideration of all the peeces in particular, in beholding the whole peece together, in one ſole and ſimple viewe. The firſt kind reſembles meditation, in which, for example, we conſider the effectes of God's mercy, to excite vs to his loue; but the ſecond is like to contemplation, in which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, with one onely touch of our mynd, all the varietie of the ſame effectes, as an onely beautie compoſed of all theſe peeces, making vp one ſole
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:2765:197"/> shine of brightneſſe. We doe count, as it were, in meditating the diuine perfections which we find in a myſterie, but in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plating, we ſomme vp the totall ſomme: The ſpouſe her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions had asked her who was her well-beloued, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d she makes anſwere, in an admirable deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the partes of his perfect beautie: his hewe is white and redde; his head of gold, his head heire as the bude of a Palme tree, as yet not quite ſpred out, his eyes the eyes of a doue, his cheekes as little tables, placed at the corner of a garden, his lipps as Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies perfumed with odours, his hands decked with ringes of Hiacinth, his legges as Marble pillers: thus she goes meditating this ſoueraigne beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, peece by peece, till at length, she concluds by way of contemplation, putting all the beuties into one, his throte, ſaieth she, is moſt ſweete, and he wholy deſirable, ſuch is my well-beloued, and he is my deare friend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Meditation is like to him that ſmells a Pinke, a Roſe, Roſmarie, Time, Iaſmin, or the orange flowre, diſtinctly one after another; but contemplation, is like to one ſmelling the ſweete water diſtilled from all thoſe flowres: for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in one ſmell receiues all the ſentes together, which the other had ſmelt a part, and there is no doubt, but this one ſmell alone, riſing from the mixture of all theſe ſmels, is more ſweete and precious, then the ſmels of which it is compoſed being ſmelt a part one after another. Hence it is that the heauenly ſpouſe eſteemes ſo highly to be ſeene of his well-beloued with one eye onely, and that her haire is ſo well treſſed, that it ſeemes to

BERNARD, THEO: he had by peece-meale meditated all the paſsion, and he makes a Noſegay of all the prime points put together of louing griefe; and putting it vpon his breaſt, to change his meditation into contemplation, he cried out, my well-beloued is to me a Poſie of myrrhe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let vs ſee yet more deuotely the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the would, how in the Creation, he firſt meditated the goodneſſe of his workes one by one ſeuerally, as ſoone as he ſaw them produced.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2765:198"/> He ſaw, ſaieth the Scripture, that the light was good, that heauen and earth was a good thing, and ſo the hearbes, and plantes, the ſunne, moone, and ſtarrs, the liuing beaſtes, and in ſomme, all the reſt of the creaturs, as he created them one after another, till at length all the vniuers being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, the diuine meditation doth as it were, turne into Contemplation: for viewing all the goodneſſe that was in his workes with one onely glance of his eye, He ſaw, ſaieth Moyſes, all that he had made, and all of it was very good. The ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie parts conſidered ſeuerally by manner of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, were good, but beheld in one onely looke together in forme of contemplation, they were found very good: as many little brookes ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together makes a riuer, which doth carie greater fraightes, then the multitude of the ſame brookes ſeuerally could doe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After we haue moued a great many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pious affections by the multitude of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of which meditation is compoſed, we doe in the end gather together the vertue of all theſe affections, from which by the confuſion and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their forces, doth ſpring a certaine quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of affection, and of affection more actiue and puiſſant, then all the affections whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, becauſe though it be but one, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it the vertue and propertie of all the others, and is called a contemplatiue affection.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So it is an opinion amongſt Diuines, that Angels higher in glorie haue a knowledge of God and the creaturs, much more ſimple, then ſuch as are inferiour, and that the SPECIES or ID<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2765:199"/> by which they ſee, are more vniuerſall: ſo that, what the leſſe perfect Angels ſee by diuers SPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIES and lookes, the more perfect ſee by fewer SPECIES and caſtes of the eye. And the Great S. AVGVSTINE, followed by S.

By how much further water runs from its ſource by ſo much the more it doth deuide it ſelfe and weare out its banks if it be not kept in by a continuall care: and perfections doe ſeperate and deuid themſelues, according as they are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from God their ſource; but approaching nigh him, they are vnited, till ſuch time as we shall be ſwallowed vp in this ſoueraignely ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is the neceſſarie vnitie, and THE BETTER PART, that which MAGDALEN made choice of, and which shall not be taken away from her.</p>

               <head>That we doe contemplate without paine, which is a third difference betwixt it and meditation. <hi>CHAPTER. VI.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NOw the ſimple view of contemplation is performed in one of theſe three fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2765:199"/> we doe ſometimes onely eye ſome one of Gods perfections, as for example, his infinite Bountie, not thinking of the other ATTRIBVTS, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues thereof: As a Bridegroome, ſimply ſtaying his eye vpon the faire complection of his Bride, yet by this meanes should truely ſee all her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, for as much as the complection is ſpred in a ſort, through all the partes thereof, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d should not be attentiue, to the feature, grace, or other reſpectes of beautie: for in like manner, the mind often times conſidering the ſoueraigne goodneſſe of the DIVINITIE; although withall, it ſees the IVSTICE, WISDOME, and POWER, yet is it onely attentiue to the GOODNESSE, to which the ſimple view of it's contemplation is addreſſed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo we doe attentiuely behold in God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his infinite perfections, yet with a ſimple view, and without diſtinction, as he, who with one glance of his eye paſsing his view from the top to the toe of his ſpouſe, richly deckt, should attentiuely in generall haue ſeene all, and nothing in particular; not well diſcerning what carkanet, or gowne she wore, nor what countenance she had, or how she lookt, but onely, that all was faire and comely: For ſo in contemplation, we often paſſe ouer ſundrie Diuine Greatneſſes and perfections in generall, with one onely touch of conſideration, with out being able to render a reaſon of any thing in particular, ſaue onely, that all is perfectly good and faire: and finally, we doe at other times conſider, neither many nor onely one of the diuine perfections, but onely ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine action or worke, to which we are attentiue;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2765:200"/> as for example, to the act of MERCY, by which God pardons ſinnes; or the act of Creation, or the Reſurrection of Lazarus, or Conuerſion of S. PAVLE; as a Bridegroome who should not eye his Spouſes eyes, but onely the ſweeteneſſe of the lookes she caſtes vpon him; nor take notice of her mouth, but onely of the delight of the words vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by it. And in this point, THEO: the ſoule makes a certaine ſallie of loue, not onely vpon the actions she conſidereth, but vpon him whence they proceede. Thou art Good ô Lord; and in thy goodneſſe, teach me thy iuſtifications: Thy throte, that is the word which cometh from it, is moſt delicious, and thou art wholy deſirable. Ah! how ſweete are thy words to my bowells, ſweeter then honie to my mouth: or elſe with S. THOMAS, My Lord my God; and with S. MAGDELEN RAB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BONI, ah Maiſter!</p>
               <p n="2">2. But take which of theſe three wayes you will, Contemplation hath ſtill this excellencie, that it is done with delight, for that it ſuppoſeth, that God and his holy loue is found, that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, delighted in, ſaying, I haue found him, whom my heart loueth, I haue found him, nor will I let him goe. In which it differs from Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which almoſt alwayes is performed in paine, labour, and diſcourſe: our mind paſsing in it from conſideration to conſideration, ſearching in many places, either the well-beloued of her Loue, or the loue of her well-beloued. IACOB labours in meditation to obtaine Rachel: but in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he reioyceth with her, forgetting his labours. The diuine Spouſe, as a shephearde, which he alſo
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2765:200"/> is, prepared a ſumptious banquet, according to the countrie fashion, for his ſacred Spouſe; which he ſo deſcribed, that myſtically it repreſented all the myſteries of mans Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption; I came into my garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quoth he, I haue gathered my myrrhe, with all my perfumes, I haue eaten my honie-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be with my honie, I haue mingled my wine with my milke: eate my frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d drinke, and inebriate your ſelues my deareſt. THE: ha! when was it I pray you, that our Sauiour came into his garden, if not when he came into his mothers pureſt, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleſt and ſweeteſt wombe, replenished with all the flourishing pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of holy vertues? And what is ment by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours gathering of his myrrhe, with his perfumes, but to ioyne ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſuffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vntill death, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d death of the croſſe: heaping by that meanes merit vpon merit and treaſurs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treaſurs, to enrich his ſpirituall children? And how did he eate his honie-combe with his honie, but when he liued a new life, reuniting his ſoule more ſweete then honie, to his pearced and wounded bodie, with more holes then a honie-combe? And when aſcending into heauen he tooke poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the circumſtances, and dependance of his diuine glorie, what other thing did he, if not mixe the reioycing wine of the eſſentiall glorie of his ſoule, with the delightfull milke of the perfect felicitie of his bodie, in a more excellent manner then hitherto he had done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now in all theſe diuine myſteries which containe all the others, there is ſufficient to eate and drinke for all the deare friends, and to ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briate the deareſt; ſome of them doe eate and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2765:201"/> drinke, but they eate more then they drinke, and ſo are not drunke: others eate and drinke but drinke more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eate, and thoſe are they that are inebriated. Now to eate is to meditate; for in meditating a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth chewe, turning his ſpirituall meate hither and thither betwixt the teeth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to bruiſe, breake, and digeſt it, which is not done without ſome trouble: To drinke is to contemplate, which we doe without paine or difficultie, yea with pleaſure, and facilitie but to be inebriated, is to contemplate ſo freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ardently, that one is quite out of himſelfe to be wholy in God. O holy and ſacred drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which contrarie to corporall drunkenneſſe, doth not alienate vs from ſpirituall, but from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſenſe, not dulling or beſotting vs, but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizing, and in a ſort, Deifying vs; putting vs out of our ſelues, not to abaſe vs, and ranke vs with beaſtes, as doth terreane dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kenneſſe, but to raiſe vs aboue our ſelues, and range vs with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ſo that we might liue more in God then in our ſelues, being attentiue and buſied by loue to ſee his beautie and be vnited to his Bountie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now whereas to attaine vnto contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſtand ordinarily in neede to heare the word of God, to haue ſpirituall diſcourſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with others, as had the auncient Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, to reade deuote bookes, to praie, meditate, ſing canticles, conceiue good thoughtes: for this reaſon holy contemplation being the end and aime of all theſe exerciſes, they are all reduced vnto it, and ſuch as practiſe them are called CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEMPLATIVES,

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. I Speake not here, THEO: of the recollection by which ſuch as are about to praie, vſe to place themſelues in God's preſence, entring into themſelues, and, as one would ſaie, retiring their ſoule with in their heart, there to ſpeake with God: For this recollection is made by Lous commaund, which prouoking vs to praie, moues vs to ſerue our ſelues of this meanes to praie well, ſo that we our ſelues are cauſe of this retiring of our ſoule. But the recollection of which I meane to ſpeake, is not made by lous commaund, but by loue it ſelfe: that is, we doe not make it by free choiſe, it nor being in our power to haue it when we pleaſe, not depending of our care: but God, at his pleaſure works it in vs, by his holy grace. He, ſaied the B. Mother Saint Tereſa of IESVS, who wrote, that the Praier of Recollection,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2765:202"/> is made as when an VRCHIN or TORTIS doe drawe themſelues together, ſaied well, ſauing that theſe beaſtes drawe themſelues vp when they pleaſe, whereas recollection is not in our will, but onely when it pleaſeth God of his grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe it vpon vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now thus it is done. Nothing is ſo naturall to good, as to draw and vnite vnto it ſelfe ſuch things as are ſenſible of it, as doe our ſoules which draw continually and tend towards their treaſure, that is towards that which they loue. Herevpon it fals out ſometimes, that our Sauiour doth imperceptibly poure into the bottome of our hearts, a certaine agreeable ſweeteneſſe in argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his preſence, and then the powers, yea the very exteriour ſenſes of the ſoule, by a certaine ſecrete contentment doe turne it vpon that inward part, where the moſt amiable and deareſt ſpouſe is lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: For as a young ſwarme of Bees, while they are ready to take flight, and chang their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, is recalled by the ſofte ſound of a baſon, the ſmell of Metheglin, or elſe by the ſent of ſome odoriferous hearbs, ſo that they ſtaie by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of theſe ſweetes, and enter into the hyue prepared for them: So our Sauiour pronouncing ſome ſecret word of his loue, or pouring out the odour of the wine of his dilection more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then honie, or elſe ſtreaming the perfumes of his garments, that is ſome ſenſe of diuine conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in our heartes, and therby making them perceiue his moſt gratefull preſence, he drawes vnto him all the faculties of our ſoule, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about him, and ſtaie in him, as in their moſt
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2765:202"/> deſired obiect. And as he that should caſt a peece of an Adamant amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt many needles, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſee them turne all their pointes towards their well-beloued Adamant, and hang vpon it: ſo when our Sauiour makes his delightfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to be felt in the midſt of our heartes, all our faculties turne their points that way, to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that incomparable ſweeteneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. O God ſaieth then the ſoule, imitating S. AVGVSTINE whither doe I wander ſearching thee? ô infinite Beautie; I ſought thee with out, and thou waſt in the midſt of my heart. All Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens affections, and all her thoughtes were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about the Sepulcher of her Sauiour, whom she went queſting here and there: and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede she had found him, and he ſpoke to her: yet leaues she them diſperced, becauſe she doth not perceiue his preſence; but as ſoone as he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her by name, behold her gathered together, and laied faſt at his feete: one onely word, puts her into Recollection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Propoſe to your ſelfe, THEOT: the moſt holy Virgin our Lady, when she had conceiued the Sonne of God, her onely Loue; the ſoule of this well-beloued mother doth wholy recollect it ſelfe about this well-beloued child; and becauſe this heauenly friend, was harboured in her ſacred entrals, all the faculties of the ſoule doe gather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, as holy bees into their hyue wherein their honie was. And by how much the diuine greatneſſe was by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſpeach more reſtrained a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d leſſened in the virginall wombe, by ſo much her ſoule did more dilate it ſelfe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d magnifie the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2765:203"/> praiſes of that infinite clemencie, and her Spirit within her bodie lept with ioye (as S. IOHN in his mothers wombe in preſence of his God) which she felt. She lanched not her affections out of her ſelfe, ſith that her loues, her delightes were in the mideſt of her ſacred wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be. Now this ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be practiſed, by imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſuch as hauing communicated, doe perceiue by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith, that which neither flesh nor blood, but the heauenly Father hath reuealed vnto them, that their Sauiour, is in bodie and ſoule preſent, by a moſt reall preſence to their bodie and ſoule in the moſt adorable Sacrament: for as the Mother-pearle hauing receiued the fresh morning drops of dewe, doth shut her ſelfe, not onely to conſerue them pure from all mixture of ſea-water, but alſo for the delight she taks to feele the gracious fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this gift from heauen; ſo it fals out with diuers holy and deuote ſoules, that hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Bleſſed Sacrament, which containes all the dewe of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly benedictions, their ſoule shutteth it ſelfe, and all her faculties are retired, not onely to adore this ſoueraigne king, newly preſent by an admirable preſence in their breaſtes, but alſo for the incredible conſolation, and ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing which they receiue, to perceiue by faith the diuine shute of immortalitie within them; where you are diligently to note, THEO: that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede all this recollection is made by loue, which perceiuing the preſence of the well-beloued by the baits it caſtes in the mideſt of the heart, doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and drawe all the ſoule towards it by a moſt amiable inclination, moſt ſweete turning, and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2765:203"/> moſt delicious winding of all faculties towards the well-beloued, who drawes them vnto him by the force of his ſweeteneſſe, with which he drawes, and ties the heart, as bodies are drawen by materiall ropes, or bands.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This ſweete recollection of our ſoule in her ſelfe, is not onely made by the apprehenſion of Gods preſence in the midſt of our heart, but euen by placing our ſelues in any manner in his ſacred preſence. It happens often times, that all our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour powers doe gather and shut themſelues vp in them ſelues, vpon an extreame reuerence and ſweete feare, which doth ſeaſe vpon vs, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his ſoueraigne Maieſtie, who is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with vs, and beholds vs; So that, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we are diſtracted, if the Pope, or ſome great Prince should appeare, we recall our thoughtes and reflect vpon our ſelues, that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our ſelues and reſpectiue. The blew Lillie, or flowerdeluce is ſaied to shut it ſelfe at the ſight of the Sunnes approach; becauſe by his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it doth shut and locke it ſelfe vp within it ſelfe, in whoſe abſence it remaines deſplaied, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the night. The like happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this recollectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which we ſpeake: for vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the onely preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God or feeling we haue that he beholds vs, either from heauen, or from any other place out of vs, though as then we thinke not of the other preſence, by which he is in vs, our powres and faculties doe aſſemble, and gather together within vs, out of reſpect to his diuine Maieſtie, which loue makes vs feare, with a feare of honour and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:2765:204"/>6. Verily I was acquainted with a ſoule, to whom as ſoone as one mentioned any myſterie or ſentence, which put her a little more expreſſely then ordinary, in minde of the preſence of God, either in confeſsion or priuate conference, she would ſo deeply e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter into her ſelfe, that she could hardly recouer her ſelfe to ſpeake and make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare; ſo that outwardly she remained as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of life, and all her ſenſes were abſorpt, till her Spouſe permitted her to returne, which was ſometime ſooner, ſometime later.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe ſoule then being thus recollected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her ſelfe, in God, or before God, doth now and then become ſo ſweetly attentiue to the goodneſſe of her well-beloued, that her atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion ſeemes not to her to be attention, ſo purely and delicatly is she imploied; as it happens to certaine floods, which glide ſo faire and ſmoothly, that it ſeemes to the beholders, and ſuch as ſaile, that they neither ſee, or feele any motion, becauſe they cannot be diſcouered to ſwell with billowes, or waues. And it is this admirable repoſe of the ſoule, that the B. Virgin TERESA of IESVS names praier of quiete, not farre differrent from that which she alſo calls the ſleape of the powres, if
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2765:204"/> at leaſt I vnderſtand her right.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Certes humane Louers are ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with being heare or within ſight of the partie they loue, without ſpeaking to him, or diſcurſing alone, either of him, or his perfections, ſatiated, as it were, and ſatisfied to relish this deare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not by reaſon of any reflection they make vpon it, but by a certaine quiet, and reſt which the minde takes in it. My well-beloued is to me a Poſie of Myrrhe, he shall remaine betwixt my breaſtes: my well-beloued is myne, and I his, who feedes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Lillies, till the day approch, and shaddowes vanish. Shew me then ô thou friend of my friend, where thou repoſeſt, where thou lieſt at Noonetide. Doe you ſee, THEO: how the holy Sunamite is contented in knowing that her well-beloued is with her, or in her boſome, Parke, or elſewhere, ſo she know where he is, and thence alſo she is Sunamite, wholy peaceable, calme, and at repoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now this repoſe becomes ſometimes ſo ſtill that all the ſoule, and all her powers are put into a ſleepe, remaining without motion or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſauing the will, euen which alſo doth no other thing out receiue the content, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the preſence of the well-beloued doth afforde. And that which is yet more admirable, is, that the will doth not euen perceiue the delight and contentment which she receiues, enioying him inſenſibly, being not mindfull of herſelfe but of him, whoſe preſence yeelds her this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as it happens frequently, that taken by a light ſlumber, we doe onely heare indiſtinctly

Notwitſtanding, the ſoule who in this ſweete repoſe, doth enioye this delicate touch of the diuine preſence, though she doe not perceiue it as an enioying, yet doth she clearely shew how deare and precious this happineſſe is vnto her, if one offer to depriue her of it, or diuert her from it: for then the poore ſoule plaines, cries out, yea ſometime weepes, as a little child awaked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had yet taken his full ſleepe, who by the griefe he reſenteth in being awaked, doth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew, the content he had in ſleeping. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the heauenly shephearde adiureth the daughters of Hieruſalem by their Roes, and the Harts of the fields, that they should not raiſe vp the Beloued, till herſelfe would. That is, that she should riſe of her ſelfe. No THEO: a foule thus recollected in her God, would not chang her repoſe for all the riches in the world.</p>

Behold her I beſeech you THEO: she is ſet in a profound tranquillitie, she ſpeakes not, she weepes not, she ſighes not, she grones not, she ſtirres not, she praies not. Martha full of buſineſſe paſſeth and repaſſeth through the Hall, Marie regardes her not. And what doth she doe then? she doth nothing, but onely hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and what would this ſaie, she hearkeneth? It is to ſaie, she is there as a veſſell of honour, to receiue drope by drope, the myrrhe of ſweeteneſſe, which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2765:205"/> the lippes of her well-beloued diſtilled into her heart; And this heauenly Louer iealous of this loue-ſleepe and reſt of his well-beloued, chid Martha for offering to awake her. Martha, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, thou art ſollicitous, and troubled about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and yet one thing onely is neceſſarie, Marie hath choſen the better part, which shall not be taken from her.

IOHN is ordinarily painted in the laſt ſupper, not onely lying, but euen ſleeping in his Maiſters boſome, becauſe being ſet after the fashion of the Eaſt, his head was towards his deare louers breaſt; vpon which as he ſlept, not a corporall ſleepe, there being no likelihood of that; ſo I make no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but finding himſelfe ſo neare the breaſtes of the eternall ſweeteneſſe, he tooke a profound myſticall ſweete ſleepe, as a child of loue, who locked to his mothers dugges, ſuckes in ſleeping, and ſleepes in ſucking. O what a delight it was to this Beniamin, child of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours ioye, to ſleepe in this ſort in his Fathers armes, who the day after, as a Ben-oni child of griefe, recommended him to his mothers ſweete dugges. Nothing is more delightfull to the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, whether he wake or ſleepe, then his Fathers boſome and mothers breaſtes.</p>

HAue you neuer noted, THEO: with what feruour little children doe ſometimes cleeue to their mothers duggs being hungrie, you shall ſee them with a low muttering, hold faſt and preſſe the Pap in there mouth, ſucking ſo greede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they euen put their mother to paine: but after the freshneſſe of the milke, hath in ſome ſort appeaſed the coueting heat of their tender ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, and the delightfull vapours which it ſendes to the braine begin to lull them a ſleepe, THEO: you shall ſee them foftly shut their little eies, and by little and little giue way to ſleepe, yet without letting goe the Pap, vpon which they make no action, ſauing, a ſlow and almoſt inſenſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lips, wherby continually they drawe the milke which they let downe imperceptibly; and this they doe without thinking of it, yet not without pleaſure: for if one drawe the Pap from them before they fall ſound a ſleepe, they awake and weepe bitterly, teſtifying by the ſorrow which
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2765:206"/> they shew in the priuation, that their content was great in the poſſeſſion. Now it faires in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the ſoule who is in reſt and quiet before God; for she ſuckes, in a manner, inſenſibly the delightes of this preſence, without diſcours, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or motion at all of any her faculties, ſaue the onely point of the will, which she moues ſoftly snd almoſt vndiſcouerably, as the mouth by which the delight and inſenſible ſacietie she takes in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying the diuine preſence. But if one trouble this poore little babe, or offer to take from it the Pap for that it ſeemes to ſleepe, it will plainly shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that though it ſleepe to all other things, yet not to that; for it perceiues the diſcomoditie of this ſeparation, and greeues at it, shewing therby, the pleaſure which it tooke, (though not thinking of it;) in the good which it did poſſeſſe. The B. S. TERESA, hauing written that she found this a fit ſimilitude, I thought good to declare it ſo to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But tell me THEOT: the ſoule recollected in her God, at what I praie you should she be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted? hath she not reaſon to be quiete and remaine in reſt? For indeede whom should she ſearch? She hath found him whom she ſought. What reſteth now for her but to ſaie I haue ſound my deare well-beloued, I hold him, nor will I let him goe. She hath no neede to trouble her ſelfe with the diſcours of the vnderſtanding; for she ſees her Spouſe preſent, at ſo cleare a view, that diſcours were to her vnprofitable, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. And againe though she should not ſee by the vnderſtanding, she cares not, being content in
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2765:207"/> feeling his preſence by the delight and ſatisfaction which the will receiues in it. Ah! the mother of God, our B. Ladie and Miſtreſſe, being with child and not ſeeing that diuine babe, but feeling it in her ſacred wombe, ah God! what content had she therein? and did not S. ELIZABETH, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enioy the fruites of our Sauiours Diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without ſeeing him, vpon the day of the moſt holy Viſitation? Nor doth the ſoule in this repoſe, ſtand in neede of memorie, her Louer being preſent; nor yet of imagination. For to what end were it to repreſent him in an exteriour, or interiour picture, whoſe preſence we are poſſeſſed of? So that to conclude, it is the will alone that doth ſoftely, and as it were in gentle shuts, drawe the milke of this ſweete preſence, all the reſt of the ſoule repoſing in the ſweeteneſſe of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which she takes.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THere are ſome Spirits which are actiue, fertill, and ſtirring, in conſideration: others, that are ſupple and flexible, and ſuch as deſire to taſte, what they doe, to ſee and examine each thing that paſſeth in them, turning their eies perpetually vpon themſelues to diſcouer their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement. There are yet others, who are not content to be content, vnleſſe they feele, ſee and ſauoure their contentment, and are like to ſuch, as being well couered againſt the cold, would not beleeue it, if they knew not how many garments they wore; or ſuch as ſeeing their Cloſets full of money, would not eſteeme themſelues rich, vnleſſe they knew the number of their crownes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now all theſe Spirits are ſubiect to be troubled in Praier: for if God daigne them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred repoſe of his preſence, they doe willingly forſake it, to note their owne comportment in it and to examine whether they haue true content, diſquieting themſelues to diſcerne whether their
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2765:208"/> quietneſſe, quiete: ſo that in lieu of imploying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſweetely to perceiue the ſweetes of the diuine preſence, they diſtract their vnderſtanding in diſcourſing vpon the feeling they haue; as a Bride that should buſie her ſelfe in beholding, her wedding Ring, without looking vpon the Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome who gaue it her. There is a faire diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, THEO: betwixt being occupied in God who giues vs the contentment, and being buſied in the contentment which God gaue vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoule to whom God giues the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of loue in Praier, muſt abſtaine, as much as she is able, from looking vpon her ſelfe, or her repoſe, which to be conſerued, muſt not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly obſerued; for he that doth loue it too much doth looſe it, and the beſt manner of louing it, is to loue it without affectation and as a child, who to ſee where his feete were, had taken his head from his mothers breaſt, doth with a ſodaine iert returne to it againe in a harmeleſſe wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So if we perceiue our ſelues diſtracted through a curioſitie which we haue to know what we doe in Praier, we muſt reſtore our hearts, to the ſweete and peaceable attention of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from whence we ſtraied. Yet are we not to apprehend any danger of looſing this ſacred repoſe by actions of bodie or minde, which are not done vpon lightneſſe, or indiſcretion: for as S. TERESA ſaieth, it were a ſuperſtition to be ſo iealous of this repoſe, as not to coffe, ſpit, or breath, for feare of looſing it; ſith that God who giues this peace, doth not with drawe it, for ſuch neceſſarie motions, nor yet for the diſtractions
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2765:208"/> and wandrings of the minde which are not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: and the will hauing once well taſted the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine preſence, doth not ceaſe to relish the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, though the vnderſtanding, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie should make an eſcape, and ſlipe after ſtrang and fruitleſſe thoughtes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is true, the repoſe of the ſoule is not then ſo great as when the vnderſtanding and memorie doe conſpire with the will, yet is it a true ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall tranquilitie, ſith it raignes in the will which is the miſtreſſe of all the other faculties. Verily I knew a ſoule extreamely ſixed and vnited to her God, who yet had her vnderſtanding, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſo free from all exteriour imploiments, that she vnderſtood very diſtinctly all that was ſaied about her, and did entirely remember it, though she could not anſwere, or looſe her ſelfe from God, to whom she was tied, by the application of her will; but I ſaie she was ſo tied, that she could not be withdrawen from this ſweete entertainment, without greate griefe, prouoking her to ſighings, which she vſed in her greateſt conſalation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: as we ſee young children murmur, and make little plaints, when after an ardent deſire they begin to ſucke: or as IACOB did, who in kiſſing the faire, and chaſt Rachell lancing out a ſigh, wept through the vehemencie of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and tenderneſſe which he felt: ſo that the ſoule, I ſpeake of, hauing her onely will enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but her vnderſtanding, memorie, hearing, and imagination free, reſembled in my opinion, a little childe ſucking, who could heare, ſee, and ſtirre his armes, without quitting his dere Pap.</p>

                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:2765:209"/>5. Howbeit the peace of the ſoule should be much greater, and ſweeter, if there were no noiſe made about her, nor occaſion giuen of ſtirring herſelfe, either in bodie or minde: for she would be wholy occupied, in the ſweeteneſſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine preſence: but not being able wholy to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtractions in her other faculties, in her will at leaſt, she conſerues peace, which is the powre wherby she hath the fruition of good. And note, that then the will being kept quiet, by the pleaſure which she takes in the diuine preſence, doth not endeauour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire the other ſtraying powres, becauſe by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

ELIZAB<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>TH, when our B. Ladie viſited her: and at other times, the ſoule hath a certaine burning delight to be in Gods preſence, which as then she diſcerns not; as it happened to the pilgrime-Apoſtles, who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with our Sauiour ſcarcely perceiued the deare delight, with which they were touched, till ſuch time as they were arriued, and diſcouered him in the diuine breaking of the bread. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe, the ſoule doth not onely perceiue Gods preſence, but hears him ſpeake, by certaine inward illuminations, and perſuaſions, which are in lieu of words: Sometimes she perceiues him a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſpeakes to him at once, but ſo ſecretly, ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and delicatly, that it doth not impeach her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace and quiet; ſo that without being awaked, she wakes with him, that is, she wakes and ſpeakes to her well-beloued heart with ſo ſweete tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, and gracious repoſe, as though she ſwete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flept. At other times she hears the Spouſe ſpeake, but she cannot ſpeake to him, the delight she hath to heare him, or the reuerence she bears him, keeping her in ſilence: or elſe through dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and feebleneſſe of mind, hauing ſtrength to heare onely, not to ſpeake; as it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens corporally to ſuch as begin to ſleepe, or haue bene wakned by ſickneſſe.</p>

                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:2765:210"/>2. But finally, ſometimes she neither hears, nor ſpeakes to her well-beloued, nor yet diſcouers any ſigne of his preſence, but ſimply knowes, that she is in the preſence of God, who is pleaſed with her being there. Imagine, THEOT: that the glorious Apoſtle S.

And at our awaking; if we reflect vpon it, we finde that God was ſtill preſent with vs, and that we were in no wiſe abſent, or ſeparated from him. We were there then in the preſence of his good pleaſure, though without ſeeing or perceiuing him; ſo that we might ſaie with Iacob: Certes I haue ſleept by my God, and in the boſome of his diuine preſence, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and yet knew it not.</p>

We call ſuch, hearts of Iron, woode, or ſtone, as doe not eaſily receiue the diuine impreſsions, but linger in their owne will amid'ſt the inclinations which doe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie our depraued nature: contrariwiſe a ſuple, pliable, and tractiue heart, is termed a melting, and liquifying heart. My heart, ſaieth DAVID ſpeaking in the perſon of our Sauiour vpon the croſſe, is made as melted waxe in the midſt of my bellie. CLEOPATRA that infamous Queene of Egipt, ſtriuing to outuie Marke ANTONIE in all the exceſſes and diſſolutions of his banquets, in the end of one of them she made in her turne called for a viall of fine vineger, and dropt into it, one of the pearles which she wore in her eares, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fiftie crownes, which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, melted and liquified, she tooke it downe, and had yet buried the pearle she bore in her other eare, in the ſinke of her villanous ſtomake, if Lucius Plautus had not hindred her. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours heart, the true Orientall pearle, ſingularly ſingular, and priſeleſſe, throwen into the mideſt of an incomparably bitter ſea, in the day of his paſſion, melted in it ſelfe, diſſolued, liquified, and flowed in griefe vnder the preſſe of ſo many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall anguishes, but loue, ſtronger then death, did mollifie, ſoften, and melt the heart, ſooner then the other paſsions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My heart ſaied the holy Spoufe was wholy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2765:212"/> diſſolued at my well-beloued his voice, and what is it to ſaie, it is diſſolued, but that it is not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with in it ſelfe, but is runne out toward it's heauenly Louer? God gaue order to Moyſes to ſpeake to the ROCKE, and it should produce wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is no maruell then if he himſelfe, with his honie words can melt the heart of his Spouſe. Balme is ſo thicke by nature, that it is not flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing or liquide, but the more it is kept, the more ſtife it growes, and in the end becomes hard redde and tranſparant, yet heat doth reſolue, and make it flowe: Loue had liquified and melted the Spouſe his ſoule, whence the Spouſe cals him oile pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red-out. And behold how now her ſelfe aſſures vs, she is melted with loue; my ſoule ſaieth she melted as ſoone as my well-beloued ſpoke. The loue of her Spouſe was in her heart, and breaſt, as a ſtrong new wine, which cannot be contained within the peece; For it ouerflowed one euery ſide, and the ſoule being led by her loue, after the Spouſe had ſaied thy breaſtes are better then wine, ſtreaming out precious ointments, she addes; Thy name is, oile poured-out: and as the Spouſe had poured out his loue and ſoule, into the heart of the Spouſe; ſo she againe turnes her ſoule, into the Spouſe his heart: and as we ſee a honie-combe touched with a hote ſunne-beame, goe out of it ſelfe, forſaking its forme, doe alſo flowe on that ſide where the ſunne toucheth it; ſo the ſoule of this louer runns that ward where her well-beloued is heard, going out of her ſelfe, and paſsing the limits of her naturall beeing, to follow him that ſpoke vnto her.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:2765:213"/>3. But how is this ſacred liquifaction of the ſoule into the well-beloued practiſed? An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame complacence of the Louer in the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued begets a certaine ſpirituall impotencie, which makes the ſoule not finde any more power to remaine in her ſelfe; And therefore as diſſolued Baulme that hath no more firmeneſſe or ſoliditie, she permits her ſelfe to ſlide and runne into the thing beloued: for she neither caſteth her ſelfe by way of iaculation, nor locks her ſelfe by way of vnion, but lets her ſelfe gently glide, as a liquide and fluent thing, into the Diuinitie which she loues. And as we ſee cloudes which thickned by the winde at Noonetide, reſoluing a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d turning into raine, cannot containe themſelues, but doe fall and showre downe, and mixe themſelues ſo inly with the earth which they moiſten, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one thing with it: ſo the ſoule which, though otherwiſe in loue, remained before in her ſelfe, goes out by this ſacred liquifaction, and ſaintly flowing, and forſakes her ſelfe, not onely to be vnited to the well-beloued, but to be entirely mingled and moiſtened with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſee then deare, THEOT: that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quifaction of a ſoule into her God, is a true exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by which the ſoule trenſcendes the limits of her naturall behauiour, being wholy mixed, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpt, and engulfed in God. Hence it happens, that ſuch as attaine to theſe holy exceſſes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly loue, afterward being come to themſelues, can finde nothing in the earth, that can content them, and liuing in an extreame annihilation of themſelues remaine much weakned in that which
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2765:213"/> toucheth ſenſe; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue perpetually in their hearts the B. Mother Tereſa her Maxime. ALL THAT IS NOT GOD, IS NOTHING. And it ſeemes that ſuch was the louing paſſion of the great friend of the well-beloued, who ſaied. I liue, now not I, but IESVS-CHRIST in me, and our life is hid with IESVS-CHRIST in God. For tell me I praie you, THEOT: if a drope of Elementarie water, throwne into an Ocean of liue water were liuing, could ſpeake, and declare it's condition, would it not crie out with ioye. O mortalls I liue indeede, but I liue not I, but this Ocean liues in me, and my life is hidden in this Abiſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſoule, that runnes into God dies not: For how can she die by being shut vp in life? but she liues, without liuing in her ſelfe; becauſe, as the ſtarrs without looſing their light, shine not in the preſence of the Sunne, but the Sunne shines in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they are hid in the light of the Sunne, ſo the ſoule without looſing her life, liues not being mixed with God, but God liues in her. Such, as I thinke, were the feelings of the great S. PHILIPPVS NERIVS and S. FRANCIS ZAVERIVS, when ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloied with heauenly conſolations, they petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God that he would withdrawe himſelfe for a ſpace from them, ſith his will was that their life should a little longer appeare vnto the world, which could not be, while it was wholy hidden and abſort in God.</p>

               <head>Of the wound of loue. <hi>CHAPTER. XIII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. All theſe termes of loue are drawne from a certaine reſemblance, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the affections of the minde and the paſſions of the bodie. GRIEFE, FEARE, HOPE, HATRED, and the reſt of the affections of the ſoule, enters not into the heart, but when loue doth drawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after it. We doe not hate euill, but becauſe it is contrarie to the Good which we loue. We feare future euill, becauſe it will depriue vs, of the good we loue. Though an euill be extreame, yet doe we neuer hate it, but according to the oppoſition it hath to the good which is deare vnto vs. He that doth not much affect the Commonwealth, is not much troubled to ſee it ruin'd. He that doth not much loue God, doth alſo not much hate ſinne. LOVE is the firſt, yea the Source and origine of all the Paſsions. And therefore it is LOVE that firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the heart; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d becauſe it doth penetrate, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that well nigh to the very bottome of the will, where his ſeate is, we ſaie, he wounds the heart. It is sharp-pointed, ſaieth the Apoſtle of France, and enters the heart moſt deeply; the other affections doe alſo enter, but by the meanes of loue; for it is he that pearcing the heart makes paſſage. The onely point of the dart woundeth, the reſt of it doth but enlarge the wound and encreaſe paine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:2765:214"/>2. Now if it wound, it doth conſequently put vs to paine. Pomegranats by their vermillion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, by the multitude of their cornes ſo cloſe ſet and rancked, and by their faire crownes, liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, as S. GREGORIE ſaieth, moſt holy Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie all redde, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her ardour towards God, crowned with the varietie of all vertues, and who alone doth beare away the crowne of eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's, but the iuice of Pomegranats, which as we know is ſo delightfull as well to the ſound, as ſicke, is ſo compounded of ſweete and ſoure, that one can hardly diſcerne, whether it delights the taſte more by it's ſweetish tartneſſe or tarte ſweete<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe. Verily, THEOT: Loue is in like ſorte bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſweete, and while we liue in this world, it hath neuer a ſweeteneſſe perfectly ſweete, becauſe it is not perfect, or euer purely ſaciated, and ſatisfied: and yet it leaues not to be maruelous agreeable, to the tartneſſe thereof, correcting the Luſshiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it's ſweeteneſſe, as the ſweeteneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, sharpens the delight of it's tarteneſſe. But how can this be? there haue bene young men ſeene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into conuerſation free, ſound, and frolicke, who not taking care of themſelues, plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before they could get cleare, that loue, making vſe of glaunces, geſtures, words, yea of the haire of a weake and fraile creature, as of ſo many darts, had ſmote and wounded their poore hearts, ſo that you shall ſee them ſorrowfull, ſad, and diſmaied. Why I praie you are they ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? With out doubt, becauſe they are wounded; and who hath wounded them? LOVE: but loue being the child of Complacence, how can it
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2765:215"/> wounde, and aggreeue? Sometimes the beloued obiect is abſent, and then, my deare THEO: Loue woundes the heart by the deſire which it excits, which while it cannot be ſaciated, it doth much torment the mind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Bee had ſtung a child, it were to ſweete pourpoſe to ſaie to him, ô my child, the very Bee that ſtung thee, is the ſame that makes the honie which likes thee ſo well; for it is true, might it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, her honie is very pleaſant to my taſte, but her ſting is painefull: and while her ſting ſtikes in my cheake, I shall neuer be at reſt: and doe you not marke, that my face is all ſwollen with it? THEO: Loue is indeede a Complacence, and by conſequence very delightfull, ſo that it leaues not in our heart the ſting of deſire, for when it leaues it, there is left with it a great paine: True it is this paine proceedes from loue, and therefore is an amiable, and beloued paine. Heare the painfull, yet louelie eiaculations of a royall Louer. My ſoule thriſleth after her ſtrong and liuing God. Ah! when shall I come, and appeare before the face of my God? my teares haue bene bread to me night and day while it is ſaied vnto me, where is thy God? And the ſacred Sunamite wholy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with dolorous loues, ſpeaking to the daughters, Alas, ſaieth she, I coniure you: if you meete my beloued, tell him my griefe, becauſe I languish with the wound of loue. Delaied hope afflicts the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now the painfull wounds of loue are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts, 1. The firſt touches that loue giues our heart, are called wounds, becauſe the heart that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:2765:215"/> was ſound, entire, and it's owne before it loued, being ſtrook with loue, begins to ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it ſelfe from it ſelfe, to giue it ſelfe to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued obiect: nor can this ſeparation be made without paine, ſeeing paine is no other thing then a ſeparation of liuing things that were vnited. 2. Deſire doth inceſſantly ſting and wound the heart in which it is lodged. 3. TAEO: ſpeaking of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly loue, in the practiſe of it, there is a kind of wound giuen by God himſelfe to the ſoule which he will perfect: for he giues her admirable fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and incomparable touches of his ſoueraigne goodneſſe, as presſing and ſoliciting her to loue him, and then she forcibly bears herſelfe vp, as to ſoare higher, towards her diuine obiect: but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing short, not being able to loue with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her deſire: ô God she feeles a paine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paragon. At the ſame inſtant that she is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully drawen, to flie towards her deare and well beloued, she is powerfully retained, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flie, as being chained to the ſeruile miſeries of this mortall life, and out of her owne impotencie she wisheth the winge of the doue, to flie to her repoſe, but finds it not. So that she is roughly tormented betwixt the violencie of her deſires, and her owne impotencie: ô miſerable wretch that I am, ſaied one of thoſe that had tried this torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who will deliuer me from the bodie of this death? And then, if you marke it, THEO: it is not the deſire of a thing abſent that doth wound the heart; for the ſoule perceiues that her God is preſent, he had already led her into his wine celler, planted vpon her heart the banner of loue; but howbeit
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2765:216"/> though already he ſee her wholy his, he vrgeth her, and from time to time toucheth her with a thouſand thouſand darts of his loue, shewing her by new meanes, how much more louely he is, then he is beloued. And she who hath not ſo much force to loue, as loue to force her ſelfe, ſeeing her forces ſo weake in reſpect of the deſire she hath to loue him worthily, to whoſe worth no force of loue can reach: alas she finds her ſelfe ſtroock with an incomparable torment: for in the ſame meaſure that she ſobbs out more deeply the longings of her coueting loue, the panges of her paine are augmented.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This heart in loue with God, deſiring infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly to loue, ſees notwithſtanding that it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue, nor deſire ſufficiently. Now this vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished deſire, is as a dart in the breaſt of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirit: yet the paine which proceedes from it is amiable, becauſe, whoſoeuer deſires earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loue, loues alſo earneſtly to deſire. And would eſteeme himſelfe the moſt miſerable man aliue, if he did not continually deſire to loue, that which is ſo ſoueraignely good. Deſiring to loue he receiues delight, but louing to deſire, he is paied with paine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Good God, THEOT: what am I going to ſaie? The Bleſſed in heauen, ſeeing that God is more to be beloued then they loue him, would ſownd, and eternally perish with a deſire to loue him more, if God's holieſt will did not impoſe vpon theirs, the admirable repoſe which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye: for they ſo ſoueraignely loue this ſoueraigne will, that the deſire thereof doth quiet theirs and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:2765:216"/> God's contentment doth content them, being willing to be limited in their loue, euen by that will, whoſe Goodneſſe is the obiect of their loue. If this were not, their loue would be equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and dolourous: delicious, by the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo great a good; dolourous through an extreame deſire of a greater loue. God therefore continually drawing arrowes, if we may ſaie ſo, out of the quiuer of his infinite beautie, wounds the hearts of his Louers, making them clearely ſee, that they doe not loue him nigh ſo much, as he is worthy to be beloued. what mortall ſoeuer deſires not to loue the Diuine goodneſſe more, loues him not enough; ſufficiencie in this diuine exerciſe, doth not ſuffiſe him that will make a ſtand in it, as though it ſuffiſed him.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NOthihg doth ſo much wound a louing heart, as to perceiue another heart woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the loue of it. The Pellican builds her neſt vpon the ground, whence ſerpents doe often ſting her younglings. Now when this happens, the Pellican, as an excellent naturall Phiſition, with the point of her beake doth wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her poore younglings on euery ſide, to cauſe the poyſon, which the Serpents ſting had ſpred ouer all the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:2765:217"/> bodie, to depart with the blood; and to get out all the poiſon, she lets out all the blood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, permits the little troope of Pellicans, to perish in this ſort; but ſeeing them dead she wounds her ſelfe, and ſpredding her blood ouer them, she doth reuiue them with a more new and pure life; her loue wounded them, and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by the ſame loue, she wounds her ſelfe. Neuer doe we wound a heart with the wound of loue, but we our ſelues are ſtraight wounded with the ſame. When the ſoule, ſees her God wounded by loue, for her ſake; she receiues from it a mortall wound. Thou haſt wounded my heart, ſaied the heauenly Spouſe to the Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite; and the Sunamite cries-out tell my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued that I am wounded with loue. Bees neuer wound, but themſelues are wounded to death. And we, ſeeing the Sauiour of our ſoules wounded by loue for vs to death, and death of the croſſe, how can we but be wounded with him, yea I ſaie woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a wound ſo much more dolorouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, as his was amiably dolorous, nor can we neuer loue him, as his loue, and death requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. There is yet another wound of loue, when the ſoule knowes well she loues God, and he treates her in ſuch ſort, as though he knew not she loued him; or were diffident of her loue: for then my deare, THEO: the ſoule is put into an extreame anguish it being inſupportable vnto her, to ſee, or perceiue, any apparence that God diſtruſts in her. The poore S. PETER found his heart full of loue towards his Maiſter, and his Maiſter making shew not to know it; Peter quoth he doſt thou
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2765:217"/> loue me more then theſe? Ah Lord ſaied the Apoſtle, thou knoweſt I loue thee. But Peter doſt thou loue me, replied our Sauiour? My deare Maiſter, ſaied the Apoſtle truely I loue thee, thou knoweſt it. But this ſo cote Maiſter, to proue him, and as shewing a diffidence of his loue: Peeter, ſaied he, doſt thou loue me? Ah Sauiour thou woundeſt this poore heart, who much afflicted cries out louingly, yet dolorouſly, Maiſter thou knoweſt all things, indeede thou knoweſt well I loue thee. Vpon a certaine day while a poſſeſſed perſon was exorciſed, the wicked ſpirit being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to tell his name. I am, quoth he, that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed creature DEPRIVED OF LOVE; and S. CATHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIN, who was there preſent, ſodenly perceiued all her bowells moued and diſordered, in onely hauing heard theſe words, PRIVATION OF LOVE, pronounced for as the Diuels doe ſo hate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue that they quake in ſeeing the ſigne of it, hearing it named, that is, in ſeeing the croſſe or be a ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the name of IESVS pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced. So ſuch as doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loue our Sauiour doe tremble with griefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d horrour, when they ſee any ſignes, or ſeen by worde that doth bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the priuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this holy loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. S. PETER was certaine that God who knew all, could not be ignorant how much he was loued by him: yet becauſe the repetition of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; Peter doſt thou loue me? hath ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of diffidence, S. PETER is much afflicted in it: Alas the poore ſoule that is reſolued rather to die then offend her God, and yet feeles not a ſparke of feruour, but contrariwiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame coldneſſe, which doth ſo benume and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:2765:218"/> weaken all her parts, that she frequently fals into very ſenſible imperfections: this ſoule, I ſaie, THEO: is all wounded; for her loue is exceeding dolourous, to ſee that God doth not ſeeme to ſee that she loues him, leauing her as one that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not to him; and she apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that amidſt her defaults, diſtractions, and coldneſſe, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour doth ſtrike her with this reproach: how can'ſt thou ſaie that thou loue'ſt me, ſeeing thy minde is not with me? which is as a dart of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe through her heart; but a dart of ſorrowe which proceedes from loue: for if she loued not, she would not be afflicted, with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion she hath, that she loues not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes loue doth wound vs in the very memorie we haue that there was a time in which we loued not our God. O how late I haue loued the auncient and new beautie, ſaied that Saint who for thirtie yeares was Hereticke. Life paſt is a horrour to his life preſent, who paſſed his life paſt without louing the Soueraigne Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes loue doth wound vs, with the meere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the multitude of thoſe that doe contemne the loue of God; ſo that hereby we ſownd with griefe, as he who ſaied, my Zeale, ô Lord, hath withered me with griefe, for that my enemyes haue not kept thy lawe. And the Great S. FRANCIS, thinking he had not bene heard, wept vpon a day, ſobed, and lamented ſo pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that an honeſt man ouer hearing him, ranne to his ſuccour, as thinking ſome had offered to kill him, and finding him all alone, asked of him, why
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2765:218"/> doſt thou crie ſo heard poore man? Alas, quoth he, I weepe, to thinke that our Sauiour endured ſo much for the loue of vs, and none thinkes of it; and hauing ſaied thus, he begun againe to weepe, and this good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fell alſo a ſobbing and weeping with him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But howſoeuer this is admirable in the woundes receiued from the diuine loue, that their paine is delightfull; and all that feele it, conſent to it, and would not change this paine for all the pleaſures of the world. There is no paine in Loue, or if any, it is a beloued one. A Seraphin on a day holding a golden arrowe, from the heade whereof iſſued a little flame, he darted it into the heart of the B. Mother Tereſa, and offering to drawe it out, this virgine ſeemed to haue her bowells drawen from her, the paine being ſo exceſsiue, that she had onely force to caſt out weake and ſmale ſighes; but yet it was a paine ſo amiable, that she deſired neuer to be deliuered of it. Such was the arrowe that God ſent into the heart of the great S. CATHARIN of Genua, in the beginning of her conuerſion, whence she became another woman, dead to the world and things created, to liue onely to her Creatour. The well-beloued is a poſie of bitter Myrrhe, and this poſie is alſo the well-beloueds, who remaines dearely ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted betwixt the breaſtes of his well-beloued, that is, the beſt-beloued of all the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loueds.</p>

IT is a thing ſufficiently knowne that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane loue, doth not onely wound the heart, but euen weaken the bodie mortally; becauſe as paſsions, and the temperature of the bodie, hath a great power to encline the ſoule and draw her after its ſo the affections of the ſoule haue great force in ſtirring the humours, and changing the qualities of the bodie: but further, loue, when it is violent, doth beare away the ſoule to the thing beloued, with ſuch impetuoſitie, and doth ſo wholy poſſeſſe her, that she is deficient in all her other operations, be they ſenſatiue, or intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; ſo that to feede, and ſecond this loue, the ſoule ſeemes to abandon all other care, all other exerciſes, yea and her ſelfe too; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Plato ſaied, that Loue was poore, trent, naked, barefoote, miſerable, without houſe, that it laie without dores, vpon the hard ground alwayes in want. It is poore, becauſe it makes one quit all for the thing beloued: It is without a houſe, becauſe it vrgeth the ſoule to leaue her owne habitation, to follow hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she loues: It is miſerable pale, leane and ruinous, for that it makes one looſe ſleepe, meete and drinke. It is naked, and barefoote, ſith it makes one forſake all other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2765:219"/> to embrace that of the thing beloued. It lies without, vpon the hard ground, becauſe it laies open the heart that is in loue, making it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt its paſsions, by ſighes, plaintes, praiſes, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, iealouſies: It lies all along at the gate like a begger, becauſe it makes the louer perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually attentiue to the eyes and mouth of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hanging continually at his eares, to ſpeake to him, and begge of him ſome fauours, wherwith it is neuer ſaciated. Now the eyes, eares, and mouth are the gates of the ſoule. In fine the condition of its life is to be ſtill indigent; for if euer it be ſacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it leaues to be ardent, and conſequently to be loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True it is, THEO: that Plato ſpoke thus of the abiect, vile, and foule loue of worldlings, yet are the ſame properties found in diuine and celeſtiall loue; For turne your eyes a litle vpon thoſe firſt Maiſters of chriſtian doctrine, I meane thoſe firſt Doctors of holy Euangelicall loue, and marke what one of them, who had laboured the moſt, ſaied, vntill this houre ſaieth he, we doe both hunger and thriſt, and are naked, and are beaten with buffets, and are wanderers; we are made the refuſe of this world, and as the droſſe, or skume; as though he had ſaied, we are ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that if the world be a Pallas, we are held the ſweepers thereof: if the world be an aple, we are the parings. What, I praie you, had brought them to this ſtate, but Loue? It was Loue that threwe S. FRANCIS naked before his Bishop, and made him die naked vpon the ground: It was Loue made him a begger all his life; It was Loue that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2765:220"/> ſent the great S. FRANCIS ZAVERIVS poore, needie, torne, vp and downe amongſt the Indians and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponians; It was Loue that brought the great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall S. CHARLES, Archbishop of Milan, to that extreamitie of pouertie, amidſt the riches which he had by the right of blood and his dignitie, that, as Maiſter Panigaroll the eloquent Orator of Italie ſaied, he was as a dogge in his Maiſters houſe, eating a peece of bread, drinking onely a little water, and lying vpon a little ſtrawe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let vs heare I beſeech you the holy Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, who cries almoſt in this manner; although by reaſon of a thouſand conſolations which loue giues me, I be more faire then the rich Tents of my Salomon, I would ſaie, more faire then heauen which is the lifeleſſe Pauillion of his royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, ſeeing I am his liuing Pauillion; yet am I black, torne, ſqualled, and ſpoiled with ſo many wounds, and blows, giuen me by the ſame Loue: ah reſpect not my heu, for I am truely browne, becauſe my beloued, who is my Sunne, hath ſtreamed the raies of his loue vpon me, raies which by their light doe illuminate, yet by their heate, I am ſunn-burnt, and made brownish, and touching me with their ſplendour they haue berefte me of my colour. The paſsion of loue hath done me too much honour in giuing me a Spouſe, ſuch as is my King; but the ſame paſſion which is a mother to me, ſeeing she alone gaue me in mariage, not my merits, hath other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which doe wonderfully aſſault, and vexe me, bringing me to ſuch a langour, that as, of one ſide I am like to a Queene who is beſide her king, ſo
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2765:220"/> of the other ſide, I am as a Vineyard-keeper who in a miſerable cabinet lookes to a vine, and a vine that is not his owne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Truely THEOT: when the wounds and ſtrokes of loue are frequent and ſtrong, they put vs into la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gour, and into Lou's well-beloued ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Who could euer deſcribe the amourous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of a S. Catharin of Sienna, and Genua, or a S. Angelo Folini, a S. Bernard, a S. Francis. And as for the laſt, his latter dayes were nothing but teares, ſighes, plaints, langours, pinings, Loue-traunces. But in all this, nothing ſo ſtrange, as the admirable communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the ſweete IESVS had with him, of his louing, and precious paines, by the impreſsion of his wounds, and Stigmats. THEO: I haue often pondered this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and haue made this conceipt of it. This great Seruant of God, a man wholy Seraphicall, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the liuely picture of his crucified Sauiour, repreſented in a glittering Seraphin, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him vpon the Mount-Aluernus, grewe ſofter then is imaginable, taken, with a ſoueraigne conſolation and compaſsion: For beholding this bright Myrrour of loue which the Angell could not ſaciate himſelfe in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; alas he ſownded with delight, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! but ſeeing alſo the liuely repreſentation of the markes and woundes of his Sauiour crucified, he felt in his ſoule the impetuous ſworde which ſtroke through the ſacred breaſt of the Virgin-Mother the day of the Paſſion, with as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward griefe, as though she had bene crucified with her deare Sauiour. O God, THEO: if the picture
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2765:221"/> of Abraham fetching deaths blow ouer his deare onely-begotten to ſacrifice him, a picture drawen by a mortall hand, had the power to ſoften, and make weepe the Great S. GREGORIE Bishop of Niſſe as often as he beheld it, ah! how extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the Great S. FRANCIS ſoftened, when he beheld the picture of our Sauiour offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon the Croſſe: A picture which not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hand, but the Miſtreſſe hand of a heauenly Seraphin, had drawen, and copied out of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall it ſelfe, repreſenting ſo to the life and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the heauenly king of Angels, bruſed, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, murdered, crucified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His ſoule then being thus mollified, ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and almoſt melted away in this deare paine, was therby greatly diſpoſed to receiue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, and markes of the loue and paine of his ſoueraigne louer: for his Memorie was wholy engaged in the remembrance of this Diuine Loue: his imagination forcibly applied to repreſent vnto himſelfe, the wounds and wane blowes, which his eyes then ſaw ſo perfectly well expreſſed in the preſent picture; The Vnderſtanding receiued from the Imagination infinitly liuelie Species: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loue imploied all the forces of the will; to take pleaſure in, and conforme her ſelfe to the Paſſion of her well-beloued, whence, without doubt, the ſoule found herſelfe tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sformed into a ſecond Crucified. Now the ſoule, as the forme, and Miſtreſſe of the bodie, exerciſing her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon, it printed the paines of the wounds, with which she was ſtrook, in the partes correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondant to thoſe, wherein her Louer endured
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2765:221"/> them. Loue is admirable in edging the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to penetrate to the exteriour: Labans yewes, while they were a ramming, had ſo ſtrong an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that it hit home vpon their Lambkins, with which they were, to make them become white, or motley according to the rods they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in the troughs where they were watered. And women with child hauing their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion refined by loue, imprinte what they liſt, vpon the child's bodie. A ſtrong Imagination, makes a man waxe white on a night, diſturbing his health and humours. Loue then droue out the inwarde torments of this great Louer S. Francis, and wounded the bodie with the dart of ſorrowe, with which he had wounded the heart. But loue being within, could not well make the holes in the flesh without, and therefore the burning Seraphin comming to helpe, darted the raies of ſo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a light, that it really printed in the flesh the exteriour woundes of the Crucified, which loue had imprinted interiourly in the ſoule. So the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphin ſeeing Iſaie not daring to ſpeake, becauſe he perceiued his lips defiled, came in the name of God to touch, and purifie his lips with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cole taken from vpon the Altar, ſeconding in this ſort his deſire. The Myrrhe-tree bringeth fourth her gumme, and firſt liquor by way of ſweate, and tranſpiration, but that she may be well deliuered of all her iuyce, she muſt be helped by inciſion. So the diuine loue of S. FRANCIS ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his whole life in manner of ſweate, for all his actions ſauored nothing elſe but heauenly loue. But to make the incomparable abundance
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2765:222"/> of it plainely appeare the diuine Seraphin came to giue the inciſion and wounds. And to th'end it might be knowen, that theſe wounds were woundes of heauenly loue, they were made, not with iron, but with raies of light! ô deare God, THEO: how louing a paine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how painefull a loue was this! for not onely at that inſtant, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his whole life after, this poore Saint went pining and languishing, as being very ſicke of loue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. B. PHILIPE NERIVS at foureſcore yeares of age, had ſuch an inflammation of heart through diuine loue, that heate making way by the ribbs, did greatly dilate them, and broke the fourth and fift, to receiue aire, and be refreshed. B. STANIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAVS BOSCA, a young youth of fourteene yeares, was ſo aſſaulted by the loue of his Sauiour, that diuers times he fell downe in a ſownd, and was conſtrained to applie linnen dept in cold water to his breaſt, to moderate the violencie of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which he felt. To conclude, THEOT: how doe you thinke, that a ſoule, who hath once a little wishedly taſted diuine conſolations, can liue in this world ſo full of miſeries, without almoſt a continuall paine and languishing? That great man of God S. ZAVERIVS hath often bene heard la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ching out his voice to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinking him ſelfe all alone, in theſe termes. Ah my God, doe not for pitie, doe not beare me downe with ſo great abundance of conſolations; or if through thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2765:222"/> And therefore when God hath ſomewhat largely beſtowed his heauenly ſweetes vpon a ſoule, and after withdrawes them, he wounds her by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and she vpon it, is left pining, and ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing which Dauid.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2765:223"/> one thing to another, and thruſting or preſsing one thing againſt, or vpon another; becauſe to ioyne or vnite, it is onely required that the one be applied to th'other, ſo that they touch, and be together, as we ioyne vines to Elmes, and Iaſmins to the croſſe-barrs of Arbors which are made in gardens. But to thruſt and preſſe together, a ſtrong application muſt be made, which doth encreaſe and augment the vnion, ſo that to thruſt together, is to ioyne ſtrongly and cloſely, as we ſee Iuie ioyned to trees, which is not vnited one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but preſſed ſo hard vnto them, that it euen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrats, and enters into their barke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The compariſon of little childrens loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their mother, muſt not be left out, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its innocencie and puritie. Behold then this fine little child, to whom the mother, being ſet downe, preſents her Pape, it caſts it ſelfe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into her armes, gathering and foulding all its little bodie into her boſome, and louely breaſt; and ſee the mother as mutually receiuing it, cloſe, and as it were, glewe it to her boſome, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her mouth to it's, kiſſe it. But ſee againe this little babie allured with it's mothers huggings, how for it's part, it doth concurre to this vnion betwixt his mother and it: For it doth alſo as much as poſsibly it can, shut and preſſe it ſelfe to it's mothers breaſt and cheeke, as though it would wholy diue into, and hide it ſelfe in this delightfull wombe whence it was extracted. Now, THEO: in this caſe, the vnion is perfect, which being but one, proceedes notwithſtanding from the mother and the child, yet ſo, that it hath it's

                  </gap>ndance of the mother: for she drewe the child to her, she did firſt locke him in her treſſes, preſſed him to her breaſt, nor had the babe ſuch force, as to betake and locke himſelfe ſo hard to his mother: yet the poore little on doth for his part what he can, and ioynes himſelfe with all his force to his mothers boſome, not conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely to the delightfull vnion which his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes, but contributing with all his heart his feeble endeauours, which are ſo weake that they ſeeme rather to be eſſaies of an vnion, then an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, THEO: our Sauiour shewing the moſt delightfull boſome of diuine loue to the deuote ſoule, he drawes her wholy to himſelfe, gathers her vp, and doth, as it were, fould all her powers, in the boſome of his more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> motherly ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then burning with loue, he thruſteth, ioyneth, preſſeth, and glueth her to the lips of his delightes, and to his delicious breaſtes, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her in the holy kiſſe of his mouth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her taſte his dugges more ſweete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wine. The ſoule allured with the delightes of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours doth not onely conſent, and prepare her ſelfe to the vnion which God maketh, but in the ſtrife of her heart doth cooperate, endeauouring more and more to ioyne and locke her ſelfe to the Diuine Goodneſſe; yet in ſuch ſort that she doth ingeniouſly acknowledge, that her vnion, and tye to this ſoueraigne ſweeteneſſe, is wholy dependant of Gods operation, without which she could not ſo much as make the leaſt eſſaie imaginable to be vnited vnto him.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:2765:224"/>4. When wee ſee an exquiſite beautie beholden with great ardour, or an excellent melodie heard with great attention; we are wount to ſaie, ſuch a beautie holds the Spectators eyes glued vnto it; ſuch a melodie holds their eares faſtened, and that ſuch diſcourſe doth rauish the Auditours hearts; what is it to hold the eyes glued? the eares faſtened, to rauish the heart, but to vnite, and cloſely to ioyne the ſenſes and powers, whereof one ſpeakes to their obiectes? And the ſoule is preſſed and ioyned to her obiect, when she doth intenſely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, that preſsing being no other thing, then the progreſſe and aduancement of the vnion and coniunction. We make vſe of this word in our tongue, in morrall matters: He preſſeth me to doe this, or he preſſeth me to ſtaie, that is, he doth not meerely vſe perſuation, and intreatie, but doth it euen with earneſtneſſe, and ſtrife, as did the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes 1. Emaus, who did not onely petition to our Sauiour, but euen preſſed and vrged him by force, and compelled him by a gentle violence to remaine in their lodging with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now in Praier, this vnion is often made, by manner of little, yet freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ierts and aduancings of the ſoule towards God: and if you take notice of little children vnited and ioyned to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſtes, you shall ſee them euer and anone preſsing and ioyning themſelues, by little iertes which the pleaſurs they take in ſucking makes them giue: ſo the heart vnited to God in Praier, makes often times certaine ſurcharges of vnion by motions which doe more cloſely preſſe and ioyne it to the diuine ſweeteneſſe. As for example, The
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:2765:225"/> ſoule hauing made a long demoure in the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the vnion, wherby she ſweetely taſtes, how happie she is to be Gods; in fine augmenting this vnion by a cordiall preſsing and ierting forwards; I Lord, will she ſaie, I am thine, all, all, all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerue; or elſe; ah Lord, I am ſo verily, and will be daily more and more; or elſe by way of Praier. O ſweete IESVS, ah! drawe me ſtill more deeply into thy heart, to the end thy loue may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure me, and that I may be ſwallowed vp in thy ſweeteneſſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But at other times the vnion is made, not by iterated ierts, but by way of a continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible preſsing and aduauncing of the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diuine Bountie: for as we ſee a great and heauie maſſe of leade, braſſe, or ſtone, though not thruſt, doth ſo preſſe, cleeue to, and ſinke into the earth where it lies, that at length it is found buried, by reaſon of the inclination of its waightie poiſe, which makes it inceſſantly tend to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo our heart being once ioyned to God, if without being diſtracted it remaine in this vnion, it ſinkes ſtill deeper by an inſenſible progreſſe of vnion, till it be wholy in God, by reaſon of the holy inclination giuen it by loue, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually more and more vnited to the ſoueraigne Goodneſſe. For as the great Apoſtle of France ſaieth, Loue is a vnitiue vertue, that is, it bringes vs to a perfect vnion with the ſoueraigne Good. And ſith it is a doubtleſſe truth, that Diuine loue while we are in this life, is a motion or at leaſt, an actiue habit tending to motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen after it hath attained ſimple vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it ceaſeth not to act, though impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2765:225"/> ſtill more and more to encreaſe, ad perfect it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So trees that require to be tranſplanted as ſoone as that is done, they ſprede their roots, and lodge them deeper in the boſome of the earth which is their element, and nourishment, nor doth any perceiue this, while it is a doing, but onely after it is done. And mans heart, tranſplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the world into God, by celeſtiall loue, if it doe earneſtly practiſe Praier, certes it will continually extend and ioyne it ſelfe to the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, vniting it ſelfe more and more to Gods Goodneſſe, but by imperceptible grouths, whoſe progreſſe one can hardly diſcouer while it is doing, but onely when it is done. If you drinke any exquiſite water, to wit, imperiall water, the ſimple vnion thereof with you is inſtantly made vpon your receiuing of it; for the receiuing and vnion is all one in this behalfe; but afterwards by little and little this vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is encreaſed by an inse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſenſible progreſſe: for the vertue of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter penetrating the parts, will comfort the braine, ſttengthen the heart, and will diſperſe its force through the ſpirits;</p>
               <p n="8">8. In like manner, a taſte of loue, for example that God is good, hauing got entrie into the heart it doth preſently make an vnion, with this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but being held a while, as a precious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, it penetrats euery parte of the ſoule, poures out and dilats it ſelfe in our will, and doth, as it were, incorporate it ſelfe with our ſpirit ioyning and locking it ſelfe more nerely to ech part of vs, and vniting vs to it. And to it this which the great Dauid doth teach vs, when he compares his ſacred
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2765:226"/> words to honie: for who knowes not that the ſweeteneſſe of honie is vnited more and more to our ſenſes, by a continuall encreaſe of ſauorineſſe, while holding it a pritie ſpace in our mouth, or ſoftly ſwallowing it, the relish thereof doth more deeply penetrate our Taſte? And in this wiſe, the taſte of the diuine Goodneſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this word of S. BRVNOS: O BOVNTIE! or by theſe of S. THOMAS: MY LORD MY GOD! or theſe of MAGDALEN: AH MAISTER! or theſe of S. FRANCIS: MY GOD AND MY ALL! this taſte, I ſaie, hauing bene kept a while in a louing heart, it is dilated, diſperſed, and ſinkes into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by an inward penetration, and doth more and more perfume it with it's ſent, which is no other thing, then to encreaſe the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the nature of a precious oyntment, or Baulme, which falling vpon cotten, doth ſo ſinke into, and vnite it ſelfe to it, by little and little, that in the end one will not eaſily ſaie, whether the cotten is perfumed, or it is perfume, or elſe whether the perfume is cotton, or the cotten perfume. O how happie is the ſoule who in the peace of her heart, doth louingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſacred feeling of Gods preſence: for her vnion with the diuine Goodneſſe shall haue continuall, though inſenſible, encreaſe: and shall throughly water the ſpirit with infinite ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now when I ſpeake of the ſacred taſte of Gods preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I doe not meane it, of a ſenſible taſte but of that which doth inhabit the top, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame point of the Spirit, where heauenly Loue doth raigne, and keepe his principall exerciſes.</p>

               <head>Of the diuers degrees of the holy vnion which is made in Praier. <hi>CHAPTER. II.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. SOmetimes the vnion is made without our cooperation, ſaue onely by a ſimple conſent, permitting our ſelues to be vnited to the Diuine Goodneſſe, without reſiſtance, as a little child in loue with his mothers breaſtes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet is ſo weake, that he cannot moue himſelfe towards them, nor to cleeue to her being there; onely he is glad to be drawen into his mothers armes, and to be preſſed, by her to her breaſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes we cooperate, when being drawen, we willingly runne to ſecond the force of Gods Goodneſſe, which drawes vs, and lockes vs to him by loue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes, we apprehend that we begin to vnite and ioyne our ſelues to God, before he ioyne himſelfe to vs, for that we feele the action of the vnion of our part, without perceiuing that which God doth on his ſide, which yet doubtleſſe doth alwaies preuent vs, though we doe not alwaies perceiue his preuention: for vnleſſe he vnited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vs, we should neuer vnite our ſelues to him: he alwaies choſeth, and laieth hold on vs, before we choſe or laie hold one him. But when following his imperceptible touches we begin to vnite our ſelues vnto him, he doth often make the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2765:227"/> progreſſe of our vnion, aſſiſting our weackeneſſe, and ioyning him ſelfe ſenſibly vnto vs, in ſo much that we feele him enter: and penetrate our hearts with an incomprable delight. And ſometimes alſo, as he drew vs inſenſibly to the vnion, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news inſenſibly to aide and aſsiſt vs. And we know not indeede how ſo great an vnion was made, yet know we well that our forces were not able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, ſo that hence we make a cleare iudgment, that ſome ſecret power workes inſenſibly in vs. As Marriners loden with iron, perceiuing their shipe ſale apace with a weake gale, doe diſcouer that they approch to the Adamant rockes, which drawes them imperceptibly; and ſee in this ſort, a a ſenſible and perceptible aduancement, cauſed by an inſenſible and imperceptible meanes: for ſo when we ſee our ſoule ſtill more and more vnited vnto God, as it were by the weake endeauours of our will, we doe eaſily diſcerne that we haue to ſoft a gale to ſaile faſt, and that it muſt needes be that the Adamant of our ſoule drawes vs by the ſecret influence of his grace: which he keepes from our knowledge, to th'end it might be more admirable, and that without being occupied to diſcouer his draughts, we might with more puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſimplicitie ſtriue to be vnited to his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes this vnion is made ſo inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that our ſoule neither perceiues the diuine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in her, nor yet her owne cooperation; but finds the onely vnion inſenſibly made, to the imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iacob, who found himſelfe married to Lia without thinking of it; or rather as another
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2765:227"/> Samſon, but more happie, we finde our ſelues net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tied in the bands of holy vnion, without hauing euer perceiued it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. At other times we diſcerne the preſsing, the vnion being made by ſenſible actions, as well of Gods ſide, as of ours.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sometimes the vnion is made by the will onely, and ſometimes the vnderſtanding hath a part in it, becauſe the will doth force it after her, and applies it to its obiect, making it take a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pleaſure to be fixed to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as we ſee, loue doth endew our corporall eyes with a profound and peculiar attention, to ſtaie them in the viewe of what we loue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sometimes this vnion is made by all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule, who gather about the will, not to be vnited to God themſelues, not being all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, but to aſsiſt the will to make her v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for if euery of the other faculties, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in particular to their owne obiect, the ſoule working in them, could not ſo wholy giue her ſelfe, to the action, by which the vnion with God is made. Such is the varietie of vnions!</p>
               <p n="8">8. See S. MARCIALL (for he was, as they ſaie the bleſſed child mentioned in S. MARKE) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour tooke him, lifted him vp, and held him for a good ſpace in his armes. O pritie little Marciall, how happie thou art to be laied hold on, taken vp, caried, vnited, ioyned, and lock't to the heauenly boſome of a Sauiour, and kiſſed with his ſacred mouth, without thy cooperation, ſaue onely that thou reſiſted not the receiuing of thoſe diuine huggings! Contrariwiſe S. SIMEON
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:2765:228"/> doth embrace, and claſpe our Sauiour hard in his boſome, our Sauiour giuing no ſigne of coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating to this vnion, though, as the holy Church ſingeth, the oldman bore the child, but the child gouerned the oldma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. BONAVENT: touched with a holy humilitie, did not onely not vnite hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe to our Sauiour, but withdrewe himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his reall preſence, that is, from the holy Sacrament of the Altar, when vpon a day hearing Maſſe, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour came to vnite himſelfe vnto him, bringing the holy Sacrament vnto him. But this vnion being made, ah God, THEO: thinke with what feruour this holy ſoule cloſed vp his Sauiour in his heart! Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe S. CATHARIN of Sienna arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deſiring our Sauiour in the holy communion, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and aduancing her ſoule and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he came and ioyned himſelfe vnto her, entring into her mouth with a thouſand benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, So that our Sauiour began the vnion with S. Bonauenture; but S. CATHARIN ſeemed to begin that, which she had with our Sauiour. The ſacred Spouſe in the Canticles, ſpeakes, as though she had practiſed both the ſortes of vnions; I am who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Beloued's, quoth she, and his returnes towards me, for it is as much, as though she had ſaied, I am vnited to my deare friend, and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is nere me, to th'end that by vniting himſelfe more and more vnto me, he may become wholly mine, my deare friend is to me a poſie of Myrrhe, he shall remaine betwixt my breaſtes, and I will hold him cloſe to my boſome, as a poſie of delight. My ſoule, ſaieth Dauid, hath ſtucke to thee ô God and thy right hand hath caught and ſeiſed me.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2765:228"/> But in another place she confeſſeth that she is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, ſaying, my beloued is wholy mine, and I am wholy his, we make a holy vnion by which he is ioyned to me, and I to him. And yet to shew that all the vnion is made by Gods grace, which drawes vs vnto it, and by its allurements moues our ſelues, and giues life to the motion of our v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion towards him, she cries out as being wholy impotent, Drawe me: yet to teſtifie, that she will not permit herſelfe to be drawen as a ſtone or a ſlaue, but that on her ſide she will concurre, and will mixe her feeble motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to her Louers power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full drought. we ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſaieth she in the odours of thy perfumes. And to th'end one may knowe, that she is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly drawen by the will, all the powers of the ſoule will make towards the vnion, Drawe me ſaieth she and we will ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne; The Spouſe drawes but one, and many runns towards the vnion. It is the will onely that God aimes at; but all the other powers runne after, to be vnited to God with her.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The diuine shepheard of ſoules prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his deare Sunamite to this vnion: place me, ſaieth he, as a ſeale vpon thy heart, or as a ſignet vpon thy arme. To imprint a ſignet well vpon waxe, one doth not onely ioyne it, but euen preſſe it hard downe: ſo he deſireth that we should be vnited vnto him in ſo ſtrict and cloſe an vnion, that we should keepe his markes imprinted vpon vs.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The holy loue of our Sauiour doth preſſe vs; ô God what an excellent exemple of vnion! He was vnited to our humane nature by grace, as
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2765:229"/> a vine to the Elme, to make it in ſome ſort partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat of his fruite; but ſeeing this vnion ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen by Adams ſinne, he made another more cloſe and preſsing vnion in the Incarnation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by humane nature remaines for euer ioyned in perſonall vnitie to the Diuinitie: and to th'end that not humane nature onely, but euen euery man might be cloſely vnited to his Goodneſſe, he inſtituted the moſt holy Sacrament of the Altar, in which euery one might participate, and vnite his Sauiour to himſelfe really, and by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of foode. THEO: this Sacramentall vnion doth vrge, and aide vs towards the ſpirituall vnion, of which we ſpeake.</p>

               <head>Of the ſoueraigne degree of vnion, by ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion or rauishment. <hi>CHAPTER. III.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. VVHether therefore, the vnion of our ſoule with God be made percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or imperceptibly, God is alwaies the Authour thereof; for none can be vnited to him, but by going vnto him, nor can any goe vnto him, vnleſſe he be drawen by him, as the Heauenly Spouſe doth teſtifie, ſaying, none can come vnto me, vnleſſe my Father drawes him: which his holy Spouſe doth alſo proteſt, ſaying, Drawe me, and we will runne in the odour of thy perfumes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the perfection of this vnion conſiſteth
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2765:229"/> of two points; that it be pure a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it be ſtrong. May not I goe towards a man with intention, to behold him better, to ſpeake to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obtaine ſome thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of him, to ſmell the perfumes which are about him, to be ſupported by him? and in that caſe certainly I goe towards him, and ioyne my ſelfe vnto him: yet my approch and vnion, is not my principall pretention, but I onely make that a meanes and way to the obtaining of another thing. But if I approch and ioyne my ſelfe vnto him, for no other end, then to be neere vnto him, and to enioye this neighbourhood and vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is then an approch of pure and ſimple vnion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So, many doe approch vnto our Sauiour, ſome to heare him, as Magdalen; ſome to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, as the ſicke of the fluxe; others to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him, as the three kinges; others to ſerue him, as Martha; others to vanquish their incredulitie, as S. THOMAS; others to anointe him, as MAGDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN, IOSEPH, NICODEMVS; but his diuine Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite ſeekes to find him, and hauing found him, deſires no other thing then to hold him faſt, and holding him, neuer to quit him; I hold him, ſaieth she, and I will neuer let him goe. IACOB, ſaieth S. B RNARD, hauing faſt hold of God, will let him goe, ſo he may receiue his benediction; but the Sunamite will not let hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depart, for all the benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he can giue her; for her aime is not the benedictions of God, but the God of benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſaying with Dauid, what is there for me in heauen, or in earth what can I pretend but thy ſelfe? thou art the God of my heart, and my part for euer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus was the glorious Mother at the foote
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2765:230"/> of her ſonnes Croſſe. Ah! what doſt thou ſearch ô mother of life, in this Mount of Caluarie, in this place of death? I am looking, would she haue ſaied, my child, who is the life of my life. And why doſt thou looke him? to be cloſe by him. But now he is amidſt the dolours of death. Ah! it is not mirth I ſeeke, it is himſelfe: and my heart in loue, makes me looke all about; to be vnited vnto that amiable child, my tenderly beloued. In fine the pretention of the ſoule in this vnion, is onely to be with her Louer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But when the vnion of the ſoule with God is moſt ſtrict and moſt cloſe it is called by Diuines, an INHESION, or ADHESION, for that, the ſoule thereby is taken, faſtened, glued, and nayled to the Diuine Maieſtie, ſo that she cannot eaſily looſe, or drawe her ſelfe backe againe. Looke, I praie you, vpon a man taken, and locked by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the delight of a harmonious muſike, or elſe (which is idle) to the fopperie of a game at cardes, you would drawe him from it, but ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, what buſineſſe ſoeuer attend him at home; there is no forcing him thence, in it, euen meate and drinke is forgotten. O God, THEOT: how much more ought the ſoule that is in loue with God to be faſtened, and locked, being vnited to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie of the infinite Sweeteneſſe, and who is taken, and wholy poſſeſſed by this obiect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perfection? Such was the ſoule of that great veſſell of Election, who cried-out: To th'end I might liue with God, I am nayld to the Croſſe with IESVS-CHRIST; and with all, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, that nothing, no not death it ſelfe, can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2765:230"/> him from his Maiſter. This effect of loue was alſo practiſed betweene Dauid and Ionathas: for it is ſaied, that the ſoule of Ionathas was glued to Dauids; to conclud it is a famous AXIOME amongſt the Aunciant Fathers, that Friendshipe that can know end, was neuer true Friendshipe, as elswhere I haue ſaied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. See, I beſeech you THEO: the little childe cleeuing to, and colling his mother; if one offer to take him thence to laie him in his cradle, it being high time, he delaies and eſſaies by all the meanes he is able, not to forſake that amiable boſome; and if one make him looſe one hand, he claſpes hold with the other, but if one carrie him quite away, he fals a crying, and keeping his heart and his eyes, where he cannot keepe his bodie, with shrikes he purſues his deare mother, till by rocking he is brought a ſleepe. So the ſoule who by the exerciſe of vnion is come to be taken, and faſtened to the Diuine Goodneſſe, can hardly be pulled from it by force, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a great deale of paine. It is not poſsible to make her looſe hold; if one diuert her Imagination, she ceaſeth not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend her ſelfe taken by the vnderſtanding; and if one looſe her vnderſtanding, she cleeues by the will, or if yet by ſome violent diſtraction they vrge her will to quit her hold from moment to moment, she returns towards her deare obiect, from which she cannot be entirely vntyed, but she ſtriues all she can to linke together againe the ſweete bands of her vnion with him, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent returns which she makes by ſtelth, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing in it S. PAVLES paine: for she is preſſed
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:2765:231"/> with two deſires; to be freede of all exteriour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, to remaine with IESVS-CHRIST in her interiour and yet to put hand to the worke of Obedience, which the very vnion with IESVS CHRIST, doth teach her to be requiſite.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the B. S. TERESA ſaieth excellently, that the vnion being arriued at this perfection, as to hold vs taken and tyed to our Sauiour, is not diſtinguished from a rauishment, ſuſpenſion, or hanging of the Spirit, But that it is called onely vnion, ſuſpenſion, or hanging, when it is short; and when it is long, Extaſie or rauishment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeede, the ſoule which is ſo firmely and cloſely vnited to her God, that she cannot eaſily be drawen thence, is not in her ſelfe but in God, as a crucified bodie is not in it ſelfe but vpon the croſſe, or as Iuie graſping the wall, is not in it's ſelfe, but vpon the wall.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to auoyde all equiuocation, know THEO: that Charitie is a place, and a place of perfection: and he that is endued with more Charitie, is more ſtraitly vnited, and faſtened vnto God. And we ſpeake not of that vnion which is permanent in vs by manner of habite, be we ſleeping, or waking; we ſpeake of the vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made by action, which is one of the Exerciſes of loue and Charitie. Imagine then that S. PAVLE, S. DENIS, S. AVGVSTINE, S. BERNARD, S. FRANCIS, S. CATHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIN of Genua, or of Sienna were yet in this world, and were fallen a ſleepe, being wearied with their many labours taken for the loue of God: Propoſe to your ſelfe on the other ſide ſome good ſoule, yet not ſo holy as they, that were in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:2765:231"/> the Praier of Vnion at the ſame time: I would aske you, THEO: who is more vnited, ioyned, and faſtened to God, whether theſe great Saints that ſleepe, or that ſoule that praies? Certes thoſe are the admirable louers; for they haue more Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and their affections, though in ſome ſort a ſleepe, are ſo engaged, and tyed to their Maiſter, that they cannot be ſeparated from him. But you will ſaie vnto me, how can it be, that a ſoule in Praier of Vnion, euen vnto Extaſie, should be leſſe vnited vnto God, then ſuch as ſleepe be they neuer ſo Saintly? Why marke what I tell you THEO: that ſoule is more aduanced in the Exerciſe of vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; thoſe in the vnion it ſelfe: theſe are vnited, not vniting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, being a ſleepe: but she is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is in the actuall practiſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d exerciſe of vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Moreouer this exerciſe of vnion with God may euen be practiſed by short and paſsing, yet frequent, eiaculations of our heart to God, by way of Iaculatorie Praier made to this purpoſe. Ah IESVS who will giue me the grace to be one ſoule with thee! In fine Lord reiecting the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of creaturs I deſire thyne onely vnitie! O God thou art the onely vnitie, and onely one, neceſſarie for my ſoule! Alas, deare friend of my heart, vnite my poore lone ſoule, to thy moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Bountie! Ah thou art wholy myne, when shall I be wholy thyne? The Adamant drawes and vnites iron vnto it; ô Lord my Adamant, be my draw-heart, locke, preſſe and vnite my heart for euer vnto thy Fatherly breaſt? Ah ſith I am made for thee, why am I not in thee? Dip this drope of Spirit which thou haſt beſtowed vpon me, into
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2765:232"/> the Sea of thy Goodneſſe, from whence it flowed. Ah Sauiour I ſeeing that thy heart loues me why doth it not force me to it, I deſiring it should be ſo? Drawe me and I will runne ſeconding thy draughtes, to caſt my ſelfe into thy Fatherly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, from whence euerlaſtingly I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AN Extaſie is called a Rapture, for as much as God doth therby draw and reare vs vp to himſelfe, and a Rapture is termed an extaſie, in that we doe by it, goe and remaine, out of and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue our ſelues, to be vnited to God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the touches by which God drawes vs be admirably ſweete, guſtfull and delicious; yet by reaſon of the force which the diuine Beautie and Bountie haue, to drawe vnto them the attention and application of the mind, it ſeemes, that it doth not onely raiſe vs, but that it doth rauish and beare vs a way. As contrariwiſe, by reaſon of the moſt free conſent, and ardent motion, by which the ſoule rauished, ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes after the diuine touches, she ſeemes not onely to mount, and eleuate her ſelfe, but that she doth breake out of her ſelfe and caſt her ſelfe into the very Diuinitie. It fals out after the ſame manner, in the moſt infamous extaſie, or
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2765:232"/> abominable Rapture of the ſoule, who by the baites of brutall pleaſures, is degraded of her ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dignitie, and placed below her naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for in ſo much as she doth willingly follow this accurſed pleaſure, and doth precipitate her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, out of herſelfe, that is, out of her ſpirituall eſtate, she is ſaied to be in a ſenſuall Extaſie: but for as much as the ſenſuall baites, and inticements doe forceably drawe her, and as it were, traile her into this vile and baſe condition, she is ſaied to be rauished, and tranſported, becauſe theſe beaſtly delightes doe depoſe her from the vſe of reaſon and vnderſtanding with ſo furious a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that as one of the greateſt Philoſophers ſaieth, a man in this caſe, ſeemes to be fallen into the falling ſickneſſe, ſo is the mind ſwallowed vp and as it were loſt. O men how long will you be ſo made, as to debaſe your naturall dignitie, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily precipitating your ſelues, and diſcending to the condition of brute beaſtes?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But my Deare THEO: as touching ſacred Extaſies, they are of three kindes; the one belongs to the Vnderſtanding, th'other to the Affection, and the third to the Action: The one is in Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, th'other in feruour, the third in the worke: the one is made by admiration, th'other by deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the third by operation. Admiration is cauſed in vs by the approch of an vncoth Truth, which we neither know, nor yet hope to know: and if the vncoth Truth we meete with, be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paned with Beautie and Goodneſſe, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratition which proceedeth from it, is vety deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; So the Queene of Saba finding more true
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2765:233"/> wiſdome in Salomon, then she had imagined, was filled with admiration. And the Iewes experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in our Sauiour more knowledge then euer they had beleeued, they were taken with a great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

GOd drawes mens minds vnto him, by his ſoueraigne Beautie, and incomprehenſible GOODNESSE, which two excellences are but one Supreame Diuinitie, moſt ſingularly faire and good together. Euery thing aimes at GOOD and FAIRE, euery thing lookes that way, and are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſtaied by it; GOOD and FAIRE, is deſirable, amiable, and deare vnto all; for it, all things doe and will, whatſoeuer they will or doe. And FAIRE becauſe it doth attract, and recall all things to it ſelfe, the Grecians giues it a name which ſignifies to recall. In like manner, light is the true picture of GOOD eſpecially in that, light doth recollect, reduce and turne all things towards it ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Sunne amongſt the Grecians is named from a word, which shewes that his effect is to gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, vnite, and aſſemble things diſperſed; as GOODNESSE doth turne all things vnto it ſelfe, being not onely the ſoueraigne vnion, but ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely vniting, ſince all things deſire it, as their Principall conſeruation, and laſt end; ſo that in concluſion GOOD and FAIRE are but one and the ſame thing, becauſe all things doe couet GOOD and FAIRE.</p>

                  </gap>NIS of Areopagite: and verily it is certaine that the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2765:234"/> Source of corporall light, is the true picture of GOOD and FAIRE: for amongſt purely corporall creaturs, there is neither Goodneſſe, nor Beautie equall to that of the Sunne. Now the BEAVTIE and GOODNESSE of the Sunne conſiſteth in his light, without which nothing would be FAIRE, nothing GOOD in this corporall world: as FAIRE, he lighteneth all, as GOOD he heateth and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all: in ſo much as he is FAIRE and cleare, he drawes vnto him all the eyes of the world that haue ſight; In ſo much as he is good, and doth heate, he gaines vnto himſelfe all the appetits and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this corporall world: for he doth extract and drawe vp the exhalations and vapours, he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and makes riſe from their originalls, Plantes and liuing creatures; nor is there any generation to which the vitall heate of this great light doth not contribute. So God, Father of light, ſouerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnely GOOD and FAIRE, by his beautie drawes our Vnderſtanding to contemplate him, and by his GOODNESSE our wills to loue him; as Faire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenishing our vnderſtanding with delight, he poures his loue into our wills; as Good, filling our wills with his loue he excits our vnderſtanding to contemplate him; Loue prouoking vs to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and Contemplation to loue: whence it followes that Extaſies and Raptures depend wholy of loue, for it is loue that carries the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to Contemplation, and the will to vnion ſo that finally we muſt conclud with the great S. DENIS, that Diuine Loue is extaticall, not leauing Louers to liue to themſelues, but to the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued: for which cauſe the admirable Apoſtle S.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2765:234"/> PAVLE, being poſſeſſed of this diuine Loue, and participating the extaticall force thereof, with a diuinely inſpired mouth, I liue, ſaied he, not I, but IESVS-CHRIST liues in me, as a true Louer gone out of himſelfe into God; he liued now not his owne life, but the life of his beloued, as being ſoueraignely amiable</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now theſe Raptures of loue, are exerciſed vpon the will in this ſort, God toucheth it with the touches of his ſweeteneſſe, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a needle touched with an Adamant, doth turne and tend towards the Pole forgetfull of its inſenſible condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo the will touched with heauenly loue, doth lanche out, and adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it ſelfe towards God, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all earthly pretentions, and by that meanes fals into a Rapture, not of knowledge, but of fruition; not of admiration, but of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; not of ſcience, but of experience; not of ſight, but of taſte and feeling. It is true as I haue already ſignified, the vnderſtanding enters ſome times into admiration, ſeeing the ſacred delight which the will takes in her Extaſie, as the will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten takes pleaſure to perceiue the vnderſtanding in admiration, ſo that theſe two faculties doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchang their rauishments: the view of Beautie making vs loue it, and the loue thereof making vs view it. Rarely is a man made hote by the ſunne beames, that he is not alſo lightened; or lightened and not made hote. Loue doth eaſily make vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire; and admiration, loue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Howbeit the two Extaſies of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, are not ſo mutuall but that the one is often found without the other; for as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2765:235"/> did better know, then loue their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; ſo ordinarily good Chriſtians doe more loue then know him, and conſequently the abundance of knowledge, is not alwayes followed with the abundance of loue, like as the abundance of loue is not ſtill accompaned with the abundance of knowledge, as elſewhere I haue noted. Now if the Extaſie of admiration be alone, we are not made better by it, following that which he ſaied, who was drawen vp in Extaſie into the third heauen: If I knew, quoth he, all the Myſteries and Sciences, and should wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Charitie, I am nothing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the euill Spirit can put into an Extaſie, if we may ſo ſaie, and rauish the vnderſtanding, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing vnto it wonders which holds it in ſuſpence eleuated aboue its naturall forces, and by ſuch lightes he can afford the will a kind of vaine, daintie, nice, and imperfect loue, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence, ſatisfaction, and ſenſible conſolation. But to put the will into a true Extaſie, wherby it is entirely and powerfully ioyned vnto the diuine Goodneſſe, appertaines onely to that ſoueraigne Spirit, by whom the Charitie of God is diffuſed into our hearts</p>

Not to ſteale, not to lye, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit luxurie, to praie to God, not to ſweare, in vaine to loue and honour ones Father, not to kill; is to liue according to mans naturall reaſon: but to forſake all our fortuns, to fall in loue with Pouertie, to entitle and obſerue her in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a moſt delightfull Miſtreſſe, to repute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, contemptes, abiections, perſecutions, martyrdomes, Felicities, and beatitudes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ones ſelfe within the termes of an abſolute chaſtitie, and in fine to liue amidſt the world and in this mortall life, contrarie to the worlds opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and MAXIMES, and againſt the currant of the worlds floode, dayly by reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, renunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and abnegations of our ſelues, is not to liue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but ſupernaturally: it is not to liue in our ſelues, but with out and aboue our ſelues; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none is able to raiſe himſelfe in this manner aboue himſelfe, vnleſſe the Almightie draw him; thence it is that this kind of life is a perpetuall rauishment, and a continuall Extaſie in action and operation.</p>

The Phenix is Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix in this, that by the helpe of the Sunne beames she doth annihilate her owne life, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang it, for one more ſweete and vigorous, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were her life vnder the dead cinders. Silke-wornes doe chang their beeing, of wormes, becoming butterflies; Bees are bred wormes, then they turne Nymphes, and creepe, and finally they become flying bees. We doe the like, THEO: if we be ſpirituall: for we forſake our naturall life to liue a more eminent life and aboue our ſelues, hiding all this new life in God with IESVS CHRIST who alone ſees, knowes, and beſtowes it. Our new life, is heauenly loue, which doth quicken and animate our ſoule, and this Loue is wholy hidden in God, and Godly things with IESVS CHRIST: for as the ſacred Euangelicall Text ſaieth, after our Sauiour had a while showen himſelfe to his Diſciples in mounting to heauenwards, at length he was e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uironed with a cloude, which tooke him and hid him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their view.

And now I praie you, knowing well that IESVS CHRIST the true Eternall God Omnipotent, hath loued vs, euen to ſuffering death for vs, and the death of the croſſe, is not this ô my deare THEO: to haue our hearts in the preſſe, to feele them forceably preſſed, and perceiue loue ſquiſed out of them by violence and conſtraint, which is ſo much more violent, by how much it is more amiable and louelie? But in what ſort doth Charitie preſſe vs? the Charitie of IESVS CHRIST, doth preſſe vs, ſaieth his holy Apoſtle, waighing this matter. But what doth theſe words (waighing this matter) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? It imports, that our Sauiours Charitie doth preſſe vs then eſpecially, when we doe waigh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ponder, meditate, and remaine attentiue to this reſolution of faith. But what reſolution? marke, my Good THEOT: how he goes engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, emplanting, and forcing his conceite into our hearts. Waighing this, ſaieth he; and what?
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:2765:240"/> That if one be dead, and IESVS CHRIST died for all. Certes it is true, if a IESVS CHRIST died for all, all the are dead, in the perſon of this onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who died for them: and his death is to be imputed vnto them, ſince it was endured for them, and in conſideration of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what followes out of all this? me thinkes I heare that Apoſtolicall mouth, as a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, making an outcrie to the eares of our hearts; It followes then ô Chriſtians, what IESVS CHRIST dying for vs, deſired of vs. And what did he deſire of vs, but that we should be conformed vnto him, to th'end, ſaieth the Apoſtle, that ſuch as liue, should henceforth no more liue to themſelues, but to him that died, and roſe for them. Deare God, THEO: how powerfull a conſequence is this in the matter of Loue! IESVS CHRIST died for vs, by his death he hath giuen vs life; we doe not liue but in ſo much as he died, he died for vs, to vs, and in vs. Our life then, is no more ours, but his who did purchaſe it vs, by his death: we are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any more to liue to our ſelues, but to him, nor in our ſelues, but in him, nor for our ſelues but for him. A you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Girle of the Ile of Seſtos, had brought vp an Eagle, with ſuch dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as little childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are wonte to beſtowe vpon ſuch emploiments: the Eagle being come to her grouth, began by little and little to find her winge, and flie at bird's, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her naturall inſtinct, afterwards getting more ſtrength, she ſeaſed vpon wild beaſts, neuer failing faithfully to bring home the prey to her deare Miſtreſſe, as in acknowledgment of the breeding, which she had from her. Now it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2765:240"/> vpon a day that this young damſell died, while the poore Eagle was rouing abrode, and her bodie according to the couſtome of thoſe times, and places, was publickly placed vpon the funerall Pile to be brunt; but euen as the flame began to ſeaſe hpon her, the Eagle came in; with a quicke flight, and beholding this vnlooked for, and ſad ſpectackle, ſtrooke through with griefe, she looſed her talons, let fall her prey, and ſpred herſelfe vpon her poore beloued Miſtreſſe; and couering her with her wings, as it were to defend her from the fire, or for pities ſake to embrace her, she remained there conſtant and immoueable, couragiouſly dying and burning with her, the ardour of her affection not giuing place to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of flames and fire, that by that meanes she might become the VICTIME a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d HOLOCAVSTE of her braue and prodigious loue, as her Miſtreſſe was already of death and fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. O THEO: to what a high flight this Eagle moues vs! our Sauiour hath bred vs vp from our tender youth, yea he formed vs, and receiued vs as a louing Nource into the armes of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prouidence, euen from the time of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.

                  </q> He made vs his owne by Baptiſme, and by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible loue doth tenderly nourish both our bodie and ſoule: to purchace vs life, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death, and with his owne flesh and blood hath fed vs: Ah what reſts then, my deare THEO:
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2765:241"/> what Concluſion are we to draw from hence; but onely, that ſuch as liue, should liue no more to them ſelues, but to him that died for them; that is to ſaie, that we should conſecrate all the moments of our life, to the Diuine Loue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours death, bringing home to his glorie all our preys, all our conqueſts, all our actions, all our thoughts and affections? Let vs behold, THEO: this heauenly Redeemour extended vpon the Croſſe, as vpon a funerall Pile of honour, where he died of Loue for vs, yea of loue more painefull then death it ſelfe, or a death more pleaſant then loue it ſelfe: Ah doe we not ſpiritually caſt our ſelues vpon him, to die vpon the Croſſe with him, who for the loue of vs freely died? I will hold him, should we ſaie, if we had the Eagles generoſitie, and will neuer depart from him; I will die with him, and burne in the flames of his loue; one and the ſame fire shall conſume the Diuine Creatour, and the miſerable creature. My IESVS is wholy myne, and I am wholy his, I will liue and die vpon his breaſt, nor life nor death shall euer ſeparate me from him. Thus is the holy Extaſie of true loue practiſed while we liue not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to humane reaſon and bent, but aboue them, following the inſpiration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of the heauenly Sauiour of our ſoules.</p>

The like it is of all the habits of Prudence, Temperance, Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: They are continually in the iuſt mans heart, though they be not alwayes in action. While a man ſleeps, it ſeemes that all his habits ſleepe with him, and when he awakes, awake with him. So a iuſt man dying ſodainely, or oppreſſed by a houſe falling vpon him, kill'd by Thunder, or ſtifled with a catarre, or elſe dying out of his ſenſes by the violence of a hote Ague, dies not indeede in the exerciſe of holy Loue, yet dies he in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit thereof, wher-vpon the wiſe-man ſaieth, if the iuſt-man be preuented by death, he shall be in a place of refreshing: for it ſufficeth to obtaine eternall life to die in the ſtate and habit of loue and Charitie.</p>

VVE doe ſometimes conſider God's will as it is in it ſelfe, and finding it entirely holy and good, it is an eaſie thing for vs to praiſe, bleſſe, and adore it, and to ſacrifice our owne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all other creaturs wills to it's obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this diuine Exclamation: THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. At other times we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God's will in the particular effects thereof; as in the euents that touch vs, and accidents that befall vs; and finally in the declaration and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his intentions. And albeit that God in very deede hath but one moſt ſingular and moſt ſimple will, yet doe we deſigne it by different names, according to the varietie of the meanes whereby we know it, by which varietie alſo we are diuerſly obliged to conforme our ſelues to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſtian doctrine doth clearely propoſe vnto vs the Truthes, which God willeth that we should beleeue; the goods that he will haue vs hope for; the paines which he will haue vs to dread; that which he will haue vs to loue; the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements which he will haue vs to obſerue; and the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells which he deſireth we should follow.
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:2765:258"/> And all theſe are called God's SIGNIFIED WILL; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſignified and made manifeſt vnto vs, that his will and meaning is, that all theſe should be beleeued, hoped for, feared, loued and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now for as much as this ſignified will of God, proceeds by way of deſire, and not by way of abſolute will, we haue power either to follow it by obedience, or by diſobedience to reſiſt it: for to this porpoſe God makes three acts of his will; He willeth, that we should haue power to reſiſt; he deſireth that we reſiſt not; and yet leaues it to vs to reſiſt if we pleaſe. That we haue power to reſiſt, depends of our naturall condition, and libertie; that we doe reſiſt proceedes from our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; that we doe not reſiſt, is according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Bounties deſire. And therefore when we doe reſiſt, God contributs nothing to our diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but leauing our will in the hand of her Libertie, permits her to make choice of Euill. But when we obay, God contributs his aſſiſtance, inſpiration and grace: for permiſsion is an actio of the will, which of it ſelfe is barren, ſterill, and fruitleſſe, and is as it were a paſsiue action, which acteth not, but onely permits action: deſire contrariwiſe is an actiue action, frutefull, fertill, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, inuite and vrge. Wherefore God, deſirous that we should follow his ſignified will, doth ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite, exhort, incite, inſpire, aide, and ſuccour. But in permitting vs to reſiſt, he doth nothing but ſimply leaue vs to our owne wills, according to our free election, contrarie to his deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And yet this deſire is a true deſire: for
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:2765:259"/> how can one more truely expreſſe the deſire he hath to giue his friend a heartie welcome, then to prouide for his ſake a good and excellent ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, as did the king in the Euangelicall Parable; and then to inuite, vrge, and in a manner to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him by praiers, exhortations, purſuits, to come, ſit downe at the table, and eate. Verily he that should by force of armes open his friends mouth, crame meate into his throte, and make him ſwallow it, should not beſtowe a friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon his friend, but should vſe him like a beaſt, and a cram'd Capon. This kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, would be offered by way of inuitation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, and ſollicitation, not violently and forcibly thruſt vpon a man; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by way of deſire, not of abſolute will. Now it goes after the ſame manner in the ſignified will of God: for in it, God doth deſire with a true deſire, that we should doe that which he declares; and to this effect he doth prouide vs of all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, exhorting and vrging vs to make vſe of them. In this kind of fauour, one could deſire no more: and as the ſunne-beames remaine Sunnne-beames notwithſtanding that they are reiected, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by ſome obſtacle; ſo God's ſignified will remaines the true will of God, though it be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; true it is, it hath not the effects which it would haue, being ſeconded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The conformitie then of our heart to the ſignified will of God, conſiſteth in this, that we should will that which the diuine goodneſſe doth ſignifie vnto vs to be his intention beleeuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his doctrine, hoping according to his
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:2765:259"/> promiſes, fearing according to his threats, louing and liuing according to his ordinances, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſſements, to which all the proteſtations which we make thereof in the holy Ceremonies of the Church doe tend. Hence we ſtand while the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is red, as being readie to obay the holy ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Gods will contained therein. Hence we kiſſe the booke at the Goſpell ſide, in adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacred word which doth declare his heauenly will. Hence many Saints me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and women carried in the old time in their boſoms the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell written, as an Ephitheme of Loue as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of S. CICILE. And indeede S. MATHEWES Goſpell was found vpon S. BARNABIES breaſt written with his owne hand. Wherevpon in the auncient Councells in the midſt of the aſſemblie of Bishops, they erected a Throne, and put vpon it the Booke of the holy Goſpells, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the perſon of our Sauiour, king, Doctour, Directour, Spirit of all the Councells, and of the whole Church, ſo much did they reuerence the ſignification of Gods will, expreſſed in this holy booke. Certes that great Myrrour of Paſtours S. CHARLES, Archbishop of Milau neuer ſtudied the holy Scripture, but bare head and vpon his knees, to teſtifie with what reſpect we are to reade and heare the ſignified will of God.</p>

We doe not receiue euen that which is good in good part, being preſented by an enemies hand. The Lacedemonians would not follow a ſolide and wholſome aduiſe comming from a wicked perſon, till it were aduiſed them againe by a good man.
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:2765:262"/> Contrariwiſe, a friends preſent is alwayes grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The ſweeteſt Commandements become bitter, when they are impoſed by a tyrannicall and cruell heart which turnes againe to be moſt amiable, being ordained by Loue. Iacobs ſeruice ſeemed a Royaltie vnto him, becauſe it proceeded from Loue.

               <p n="3">3. Diuers keepe the commandements, as ſicke men take downe potions, more through feare to die damned, then pleaſure to liue according to our Sauiours liking. But as ſome perſons, haue an aduerſion from phiſike, be it neuer ſo agreeable, onely becauſe it beares the name of phiſike, ſo there are ſome ſoules, that abhorre things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, onely becauſe they are commanded. And there was a certaine man found, who hauing liued in the great towne of Paris for the ſpace of foureſcore yeares, without euer going out of it, as ſoone as it was enioyned him by the king that he should remaine there the reſt of his dayes, he went abrode to ſee the feilds, which in his whole life time before he neuer deſired.</p>
               <p n="4">4. On the other ſide, the louing heart Loues the commandements, and by how much more hard they are, by ſo much they are more agreeable becauſe they doe more perfectly pleaſe the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and are more honorable vnto him. It ſends out and ſings hymnes of ioye, when God doth teach it, his Commandements and iuſtifications.

Charitie doth not onely forbid houſe-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſell and giue it to the poore, but doth euen command them, honeſtly to gather together that which is requiſite for the education, and ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wife, children and ſeruants: as alſo kings and Princes to lay vp treaſures, which being kept together by a laudable frugalitie, not gotten by tyrannicall trikes, doe ſerue for wholſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruatiues againſt the viſible enemie. Doth not S. Paule Counſell ſuch as are married, that the time of Praier being ended, they should repaire to the well ordered courſe of their houshold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires?</p>

Euery one then, cannot; that is, it is not expedient for euery one, to obſerue all the Counſells which as they are granted in fauour of Charitie, ſo is she the rule and meaſure by which they are executed.</p>

Hence it is that vpon Charities order, Monkes and Religious are drawen out of their Cloiſters, to be made Cardinalls, Prelats, Curats yea ſometimes they are euen ioyned in matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for a kingdoms repoſe, as I haue alreadie ſaied. And if Charitie make thoſe leaue their Cloiſter, that had tyed themſelues therto by ſolemne vowe, by better reaſon and vpon leſſe occaſion, one may by the authoritie of the ſame Charitie, counſell many to liue at home, to keepe their meanes, to marrie, yea to turne ſoldiers and goe to warrs, which is ſo perilous a profeſsion.</p>

Charitie can doe all things; she hath a compleat prudence, according to that: Charitie doth nothing in vaine. Yet if any will conteſt, and demand a reaſon of her fact, she will bouldly make anſwere. That it is needefull for her

In fine she is a ſacred water, by which the garden of the Church is fertilized; and though she haue but one colour, without colour, yet the flowres which she makes ſpring haue euery one their different colour.

Certes the great king, whoſe heart was made according to the heart of God, did ſo inly taſt the perfect excellencie of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Decrees, that he ſeemes to be a Louer caught with the beautie of this Law, as with the chaſt Spouſe and Queene of his heart, as appears by his continuall praiſes thereof.</p>

So the Soule that loueth God, is ſo transformed into the Diuine will, that it merits rather to be called Gods will, then obedient and ſubiect to his will: whence God ſaieth by Iſaie, that he will call the Chriſtian Church by a new name, which the mouth of our Lord will pronounce, imprint, and engraue in the hearts of his faithfull; and then, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating this name, he ſaieth, it shall be, MY WILL SHALL BE IN IT; as though he had ſaied, that ſuch as are not Chriſtians euery one hath his owne will, in the midſt of his heart, but euery one of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours

Luke, in the multitude of the faithfull, there was but one heart, and one ſoule: for he meanes not there to ſpeake of the heart that animats our bodie, nor of the ſoule which doth animate the heart with a humane life: but he ſpeakes of the heart which giues our ſoules a heauenly life, and of the ſoule that animats our hearts with a ſupernaturall life; the ſingular hearts and ſoules of true Chriſtians, which are no other thing then the will of God. Life, ſaieth the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, is in the will of God, not onely for that our temporall life depends of the diuine pleaſure, but becauſe our ſpirituall life, is placed in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance thereof, wherby God liues and raignes in vs, making vs liue and ſubſiſt in him.

Our Sauiour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was in this world, declared his will in diuers occurrences by way of Commandement; in others, he onely ſignified it, by way of deſire: for he did highly commend chaſtitie, Pouertie, Obedience and perfect reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the abnegation of ones owne will, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhoode, faſting, ordinarie Praier; and what he ſaieth of Chaſtitie, that, he that could winne the priſe, should beare it away, he ſaied ſufficiently of all the other Counſells; At this deſire of his, the moſt generous Chriſtians, put themſelues vpon the Courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maugre all oppoſition, reſtleſſe luſt and difficulties, they haue arriued at holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſubmitting themſelues vnder the ſtrict obſeruance of the kings deſires, and by this

And doe not we ſee by experience, that pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and fruits are not come to their full groth and maturitie till they begin to ſeede and haue Pipins, whence other trees and plants of the ſame kind doe ſpri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g?

And the vertue, that beares not the ſeede or Pipin of this deſire, is not yet come to her groth and maturitie. Thou wilt not then, ſaieth S.

               <p n="4">4. Nor doe I, more then S.

Yet doe I bouldly auerre that to contemne the pretention of Chriſtian perfection is a great ſinne, and yet greater to contemne the inuitation by which our Sauiour cals vs to it, but it is an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable impietie to contemne the Counſells and meanes, which our Sauiour markes vs out to the attaining of it. It were an Hereſie to ſaie, that our Sauiour had not giuen vs good Counſell; and a blaſphemie to ſaie to God, withdraw thy ſelfe from vs, we will not know thy wayes. But it is a horrible irreuerence done to him, that with ſo much loue and delight did inuite vs to perfection, to ſaie, I will not be holy, or perfect; nor will I any larger portion of thy Beneuolence, nor will I follow the Counſells which thou giueſt me to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may indeede without offence, not follow the Counſells, for the affection we beare another way, as for example, it is lawfull for a man, not to
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:2765:269"/> ſell what he poſſeſſeth, nor giue it to the poore, becauſe he hath not the courage to make ſo entire a renunciation: It is alſo lawfull to marrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one loues a wife, or otherwiſe hath not ſtrength of mind neceſſarie to vndertake the warre which muſt be waged againſt the flesh. But to make profeſſion that one will not follow the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, nor any one of them, cannot be done without contempt of him that giues them. Not to follow the Counſell for that one hath an intention to marrie, is not euill done, but ſo to marrie as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre marriage before chaſtitie, with heritikes, is a great contempt either of the Counſellour, or of his Counſell. To drinke wine, againſt the Doctors aduiſe when one is ouercome with thriſt, or with a deſire to drinke, is not properly to contemne the Doctor nor his aduiſe: but to ſaie I will not follow the Doctors aduiſe, muſt neceſſarily proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome bad opinion one harbours of him. Now as concerning men, one may often contemne their Counſell without contemning them, becauſe to eſteeme that a man doth erre, is not to contemne him. But to reiect and contemne Gods Counſell, cannot ſpring but from a conceite we haue, that he hath not Counſelled vs well, which cannot be thought but by a Spirit of Blaſphemie, as though God were not wiſe enough, to know, or good enough to will to giue good aduiſe. We may ſaie the ſame of the Counſells of the Church, which by reaſon of the continuall aſsiſtance of the holy ghoſt, which doth inſtruct and conduct her in all truth, can neuer giue euill aduiſe.</p>

In Counſells there are diuers degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; To lend to ſuch poore people as are not in extreame want, is the firſt degree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Almes-deedes, to giue them ſome what, is a higher; a higher yet to giue them all: but the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt of all to dedicate ones owne perſon to their ſeruice. Hoſpitalitie out of the termes of extreame neceſſitie is a Counſell. To entertaine ſtrangers, is the firſt degree of it; but to ſtand in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages with Abraham, to inuite them, is a degree higher; and yet higher then that, to ſeate one ſelfe
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:2765:271"/> in a place of danger to harbour, aide and waire vpon paſſengers. Herein the great S. BERNARD of Menthon borne in this dioceſe did excell, who being extracted from a noble houſe, did for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares inhabit the shelues and topes of our Alpes, eſtablished there a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to ſerue, lodge, aſsiſt and preſerue pilgrims and paſsingers from the danger of tempeſts, who might often perish amidſt the ſtormes, ſnow, and thunder-clapes, were it not for the Hoſpitalls which this great friend of God erected and founded vpon two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which taking their names from him, are called, GREAT S. BERNARD, in the Bishopricke of Sion, and LITTLE S. BERNARD, in the Bishoptike of Thare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſe. To viſite the ſicke, which are not in extreame neceſſitie, is a laudible Charitie, to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is yet better: but to conſecrate a mans ſelfe to their ſeruice, is the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, which the Clarks of the viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſicke doe exerciſe by their proper inſtitute, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d many Ladies in diuers places, imitating the great S. SANSON, a gentleman and Phiſition of Rome, who at Conſtantinople, where he was made Prieſt, with a wonderfull charitie deuoted hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe to the ſeruice of the ſicke in a hoſpitall which he began, and which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Iuſtinian did raiſe and accomplish, by the imitation of S. CATHARINE of Sienna, and Genua, of S. ELIZABETH of Hungarie, and of the glorious friends of God S. FRANCIS, and the B. IGNATIVS of Loyola, who in the beginning of their Orders, performed this exerciſe, with an incomparable ſpirituall feruour and profit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Vertues haue then a certaine extent of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:2765:272"/> and commonly we are not obliged to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them in the hight of their excellencie. It is ſufficient to goe ſo farre in the practiſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we doe indeede practiſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage, and gaine ground in perfection, is a Counſell, the acts of heroicall vertues not being ordinarily commanded, but counſelled onely. And if vpon ſome occaſion we find our ſelues obliged to exerciſe them, it is by reaſon of ſome rare and extraordinarie exigent, which makes them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to the conſeruation of Gods grace. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Porter of the Priſon of Sebaſtia, ſeeing one of the fortie which were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> martyred, looſe courage and the crowne of Martyrdome, tooke his place, without being purſued, and made the 40. of thoſe glorious and Triumphant Souldiers of Chriſt. S. ADAVCTVS ſeeing S. FELIX led to Martyrdome, and I, quoth he, (none at all vrging him) I am alſo a Chriſtian as well as he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue in your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worshipe the ſame Sauiour; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with that kiſsing S. FELIX he marched with him to martyrdome, and was beheaded. Thouſands of the auncient Martyrs did the like; and hauing it equally in their power to auoyd or vndergoe martyrdome without offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they chooſed rather generouſly to vndergoe it, then lawfully to auoyd it. In theſe, Martyrdome was an heroicall act of force and conſtancie, giuen them by a holy exceſſe of Loue. But when it is neceſſarie to endure Martyrdome or to renounce Faith, Martyrdome it doth not ceaſe to be Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and an excellent act of loue and vallour: yet doe I ſcarcely thinke it is to be termed an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall act, not being elected by any exceſſe of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:2765:272"/> Loue, but by force of the law, which in that caſe commands it. Now in the practiſe of heroicall acts of vertue, is placed the perfect Imitation of our Sauiour, who as the great S. THOMAS ſaieth, had all the vertues in an heroicall manner, from the firſt inſtant of his conception, yea I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly adde more then heroicall, ſince he was not ſimply more then man, but infinitly more then man, that is, true God.</p>

Inſpiration is a heauenly raie, which brings into our hearts a burning light, by which at once we doe both ſee good, and are inflamed with a deſire to purſue it. Euery thing that liues vpon the face of the earth, is benu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med with winters cold; but vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the ſpringtime withall heate, they returne to their wonted motion. Beaſts of the earth ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne more ſwiftly; birds flie more quickly, and chaunt more merrily; and plants doe put out their leaues and fruite more pleaſantly. Without inſpirations our ſoules would lead an idle, blaſted and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:2765:273"/> life, but at the arriuall of the Diuine raies of inſpirations, we perceiue a light mixed with a quickning heate, which doth illuminate our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, excitate and animate our will, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her with ſtrenght to will and effect the good appertaining to eternall health. God hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med mans bodie of the ſlyme of the earth, as Moyſes ſaieth, he breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a liuing ſoule, that is, he became a ſoule that gaue life, motion and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the bodie. And the ſame eternall God, doth breath and blow into our ſoules the inſpirations of a ſupernaturall life, to the end that, as ſaieth the great Apoſtle, they might become quickning Spirits, that is, Spirits that make vs liue, moue, feele and worke the workes of grace; ſo that he who gaue vs being, giues vs alſo operation. Mans breath doth warme the things it enters into, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Sunamits child, to whoſe mouth the Prophet Eliſeus hauing laied his, and breathed vpon him, his flesh waxed hote; and it is a Maxime of experience. But touching the breath of God, it doth not onely heate, but alſo giue a perfect light, his Spirit being an infinite light, whoſe vitall breath is called Inſpiration, for ſo much as by it the Diuine Goodneſſe doth breath vpon vs, and inſpire vs with the deſires and intentions of his owne heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now God doth inſpire vs by infinite meanes, S. ANTONIE, S. FRANCIS, S. ANSELME, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand others, had frequent inſpirations by the ſight of crearurs: preaching is the ordinarie meanes: but ſometimes, ſuch as the word profits not, are
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:2765:273"/> taught by tribulation, according to the Prophet: vexation shall giue vnderſtanding in the Hearing, that is, ſuch as by hearing the heauely menaces againſt the wicked, doe not amend, shall be taught the truth by the euents and effects, and by the gripe of affliction become wiſe. S. MARIE Egip: was inſpired by the ſight of our Ladies picture; S. ANTONIE by hearing the Ghoſpell, which is red at Maſſe; S. AVGVSTINE, vpon the relation of S.

CYPRIAN (not the great Bishope of Carthage, but a lay-man, yet a glorious Martyr) was touched in hearing the diuell confeſſe his owne impotencie ouer ſuch as are confident in God. When I was a young youth at Paris, two ſcholers whereof the one was a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heretike, deboiſtly paſsing the night in the Suburbs of S.

They performe the office of Angels, and we that of brute beaſtes: and deſiring the day after to ſee, that which by his companions relation he had learnt, he found the good Fathers on their formes as a companie of marble ſtatues, ranged a long the wall in their hollow ſeates, immoueable to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but ſinging of Pſalmes, which they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a truly angelicall attention and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the cuſtome of this holy Order;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:2765:274"/> So that this poore youth wholy rauished with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration was taken with the exceeding conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he tooke to ſee God ſo well worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped amongſt Catholikes, and reſolued, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he fulfilled, to put himſelfe into the Church her boſome, his true and onely Spouſe, who had viſited him in his inſpiration, while he was laied on the infamous bed of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

O Lord, ſaied the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Eliezer, here I ſtand at this fountaine, and the daughters of the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this Citie will come forth to draw water: the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g girle then to whom I shall ſaie, let downe thy pitcher that I may drinke, and who shall anſwere, Drinke, yea and I will alſo giue to thy Camells; she it is whom thou haſt prepared for thy ſeruant Iſaac. THEO: Eliezer giues her onely to vnderſtand that he himſelfe would drinke: but the faire Rebecca obeying the inſpiration which God of his clemencie beſtowed vpon her, doth offer withall to water his Camells. Hence she became holy Iſaac's wife, daughter-in-law
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:2765:274"/> to the great Abraham, and grand-mother to our Sauiour. Certes the ſoules which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with effecting that which the heauenly Spouſe requires at their hands by his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Counſells, but doe alſo promptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie with ſacred inſpirations, are thoſe, whom the Eternall Father hath prouided for Spouſes to his well-beloued Sonne.

               <p n="1">1. THere are certaine Inſpirations which tend onely to an extraordinarie perfection of the ordinarie exerciſes of Chriſtian life. Charitie
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:2765:275"/> towards poore infirme people is an ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe with true Chriſtians, yet an ordinarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe which was practiſed by S. FRANCIS with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie perfection, as alſo by S. Catharine, of Sienna, when she licked and ſucked the vlcers of the Leprous and Cankred; and by the glorious S. LEWES when bare-head and vpon his knees, he ſerued the ſicke, whereat an Abbot of Ciſteau looſed himſelfe in admiration, ſeeing him in this poſture, handle and dreſſe the running and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered wounds of a miſerable wretch: as it was alſo a very extraordinarie exerciſe, that the holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke should ſerue the moſt abiect and vile poore people at table, and eate their leauings. S. HIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROME, entertaining in his Hoſpitall at Bethleem the Pilgrims of Europe, who fled the perſecution of the Goths, did not onely wash their feete, but deſcended euen ſo low as to wash and rub their Camels leggs, imitating Rebecca whom we lately mentioned, who did not onely draw water for Eliezer, but for his Camells alſo. S. FRANCIS did not onely practiſe pouerrie in an extreamitie, as is knowen to all, but euen exerciſed ſimplicitie in the like meaſure. He redeemed a lambe fearing it should be put to ſlaughter, becauſe it repreſented our Sauiour: he bore a reſpect almoſt to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, in reſpect of their Creatour, by an vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, yet moſt prudent ſimplicitie. Now and then he would buſie himſelfe to withdraw wormes out of the way, leaſt ſome in paſsing, should tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder their feete, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that our Sauiour had compared himſelfe to the worme. He called the Creaturs his brothers and ſiſters, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:2765:275"/> admirable conſideration, which loue ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto him. S. ALEXIS, a gentleman of a noble deſcent, practiſed in an excellent manner the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of himſelfe, liuing vnkowen for the ſpace of 17. yeares, in his Fathers houſe at Rome, in the nature of a poore pilgrime. All theſe inſpirations were for ordinarie exerciſe, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding were practiſed with extraordinarie perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In this kind of inſpiration, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the rules which I gaue for deſirs, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction. We muſt not ſtriue to practiſe many exerciſes at once, and vpon a ſodaine: for it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a trike of the enemye, to moue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and begin many deſines, to th'end that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the multiplicitie of buſineſſe, we might acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish nothing, but leaue all vnfinished: yea ſometimes he doth ſuggeſt vnto vs a deſire, to vndertake to begin ſome excellent worke, which he foreſees we will not accomplish, to deturne vs from proſecuting a worke leſſe excellent, which we had eaſily performed; for he cares not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſes and onſets be made, ſo that nothing be effected. He will not hinder the myſticall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that is the Chriſtian ſoules, to bring forth men-children, no more then Pharao did, prouided that their groth be preuented by ſlaughter. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, ſaieth the great S. Hierome, amongſt Chriſtians we doe not ſo much note the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the end. One muſt not eate ſo much, that he cannot diſgeſt it. The Spirit of guile ſtayes vs in the beginnings, and makes vs content with the florishing ſpring-time; but the Diuine Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moues vs to reflect vpon our beginnings, ſaue
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:2765:276"/> to attaine the end; neuer to make vſe of the flowres of the ſpring, but with intention, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye the ripe fruites of the Summer, and Autumne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great S. THOMAS is of opinion, that it is not expedient, to make many conſultations and long deliberations touching the deſire one feeles in himſelfe to enter into a good and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Religion and not without reaſon: For Religion being counſelled by our Sauiour in the Goſpell, what needs much conſultation? It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make one good one, with a few friends, who are prudent, and conuerſant in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch as may aſsiſt vs to make a short and ſolide reſolution. But after we haue once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated and reſolued, as well in this matter, as in any other that appertaines to Gods ſeruice, we muſt be conſtant and vnuariable, without permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelues to be shaken by any apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of a greater good; for oftentimes, ſaieth the glorious S. BERNARD the Diuell makes vs ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the riot, and to draw vs from the effecting of one good, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth vnto vs ſome other good, that ſeemes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which after we haue ſet vpon, to diuert vs from that againe, he preſents a third, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that we should often begin, ſo we neuer come to an end. Nay one is not euen to goe from one order to another without very waightie motifes, ſaieth S. THOMAS, following the Abbot Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, cited by Caſsian.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I will borrow a fine ſimilitude of S. Anſelme writing to Lanzon: As a plant often tranſplanted can neuer take roote, nor conſequently come to perfection, and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the wished fruite; ſo the ſoule
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:2765:276"/> that doth tranſplant her heart from one deſine to another, cannot profit, nor come to the true groth of her perfection; ſince perfection is not found in beginnings, but in accomplishments. Ezechiel's holy beaſts went whither the ouer bearing-furie of their ſpirits carried them, nor did they in going looke backward, but each of them went on out right before them: Wee are to goe whither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration moues vs, not turning about, or retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe, but te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding thither, whither God hath turned our face, without looking ouer our shoulder. He that is in a good way, let him worke his ſaluation. It happens ſometimes that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the good, to ſeeke the better, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing forſaken th'one, we find not the other: Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the poſſeſsion of a ſmale treaſure alreadie found, then the pretention of a farre greater, which is yet to be ſought for. The inſpiration is to be ſuſpected, which moues vs to quit a preſent good which we enioye, to purchaſe a better we know not when. A young Portugaiſe, called Francis Baſſus, was admirable, not onely for Diuine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but alſo for the practiſe of vertue vnder the diſcipline of S. PHILIPE NERIVS in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Oratorie at Rome: Now, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelfe that he was inſpired to leaue this holy Societie, to put himſelfe in a formall Order, which alſo he reſolued vpon; But the B. PHILIPE being preſent, while he was receiued into the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of S. DOMINIKE, he wept bitterly. Wherevpon being demanded by Francis Marie Tauruſe, who was afterwards Archbishop of Sienna and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, why he shed teares? I deplore, quoth he, the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:2765:277"/> loſſe of ſo many vertues: and indeede this young man, who did ſo excell in wiſdome and pietie in the Congregation, after he was become a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, was ſo inconſtant and fickle, that toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many deſires of noueltie and change, he gaue afterwards great and grieuous ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Fowler goe ſtraight to the Partridge neſt, she will come before him and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfaite her back to be broken, or that she is lame, and rayſing her ſelfe vp as though she would take a great flight, she will tumble downe of a ſodaine, with show that she is able to doe no more, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the Fowler, being buſied in looking after her, whom he thinks with eaſe to catch, may not light on her little ones in the neſt, but as ſoone as he hath purſued her a while, and thinkes he is vpon the point of catching her, she eſcapes by flying away. So the enemye, ſeeing a man by Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration vndertake a profeſſion and manner of life moſt proper for his aduancements in heauenly Loue, perſuads him, to enter into ſome other way, more perfect in appearance; but hauing put him out of his firſt way, he makes him by little and little apprehend the ſecond way impoſsible, propoſing a third; that ſo keeping him occupied in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall enquirie of diuers and new meanes of perfection, he may hinder him from making vſe of any, and conſequently from attaining the end which he ſeekes for, which is perfection. Young hounds looſe the ſent at euery double, and ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne counter: but the old and well ſented hounds neuer ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes counter, but keepes ſtill the ſame ſent
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:2765:277"/> they are vpon. Let euery one then, hauing once found out Gods holy will touching his vocation, ſtick to it holily and louingly, practiſing therein fitting exerciſes, according to the order of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the Zeale of perfection.</p>

To put on an attire, proper to a diuers Sexe, and in a diſguiſed manner to expoſe ones ſelfe to a iourney together with men, doth not onely paſſe the extraordinarie rules of Chriſtian modeſtie, but is euen contrarie to them.

Thus this birde of Paradice, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aboue without touching the ground, was a a Spectacle of Loue to the Angels, and of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to mortalls: In obedience all is ſecure, out of it, all is doubtfull.</p>

When God inſpires a heart, he moues it firſt to obedience, but was there euer a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ſenſible inſpiration, then that which was giuen to the glorious S.

For the enemy at euery turne of a hand, will put them to their wits end, to diſcouer whether they are rather to doe this or that; for example, whether they should eate with their friend, or no; whether they should weare gray or blacke clothes whether they should faſt Friday, or Saturday; whether they should recreate, or abſtaine from it, conſuming therein much time; and while they are buſie, and breake their heads to deſcerne the better, they idly ſpend the time, in which they might doe many good offices, farre more to Gods glorie, then their deſcerning betwixt good and better, wherein they are muſing.</p>

But in little and dayly exerciſes wherein the fault is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of moment, or irreparable, what neede is there to chant a QVANTA PATIMVR by engaging ones attention in importune conſultations? To what end should I put my ſelfe vpon the racke, to learne whether God would rather that I should ſaie the Roſarie or our Ladies Office, ſince there can be no ſuch difference betwixt them, that a GRAND-IVRIE should be impannelled vpon it? That I should rather goe to viſite the ſicke in the hoſpitall, then to VESPERAS.

So death, afflictions, anguishes, labours, whereof our life is full, which by Gods iuſt ordinances are the punishments of ſinne, are alſo by his milde MERCY, made ladders to aſcend to Heauen, meanes to encreaſe grace, and merits to obtaine Glorie. Bleſſed is pouertie, hunger, thirſt, ſorrow, ſickneſſe, perſecution, death: for in truth they are the iuſt punishments of our faults, yet punishments ſo ſeaſoned, or to vſe the Phiſitions terme, ſo aromatized with Diuine ſweeteneſſe, benignitie and clemencie, that their bitterneſſe, is beſt beloued.

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:2765:285"/> and incomprehenſible, come yet farre short of the crime and treſpaſſe, for which they were inflicted, rauished with Gods infinite MERCY; ó Lord, will they ſaie, how good thou art, ſince in the very heate of thy wroth, thou canſt not keepe in the torrent of thy MERCYES, that it ſtreame not its waters into the deuouring flames of Hell.

Behold Moyſes his rod vpon the ground, it is a hideous ſerpent; looke vpon it in Moyſes his hand, it is a rod of wonders. Looke tribulations in the face, they are dreadfull; behold them in the will of God, they are loues and delights. How often doth it fall out, that the potion or plaſter preſented by the Phiſition or Apoticarie is loathſome vnto vs, which being offered by ſome friends hand, (Loue ſurmounting our loathing) we receiue with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? Certes Loue doth either free labour from all difficultie, or makes its difficultie delightfull. It is reported that there is a riuer in Boetia, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the fishes shine like gold, but taken out of thoſe waters, the place of their origine, they haue the naturalll colour of other fishes.

If the Martyrs had looked vpon their torments out of this GOOD PLEASVRE, how could they haue ſunge in chaines and flames?

The Stoicks, eſpecially the good Epictetes, placed all Philoſophie in abſtaining and ſuſtaining bearing and forbearing: in forbearing and abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terreane delightes, pleaſures a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d honours; in ſuſtaining and bearing wrongs, toyles and diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. But Chriſtian doctrine which is the onely true Philoſophie, hath three principles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it doth ground all its exerciſes. Abnegation of ones ſelfe, which is farre more then to abſtaine from pleaſures: Bearing of the croſſe, which is farre more then to tolerate it: following of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour not onely in the point of renunciation of a mans ſelfe, and bearing of his croſſe, but euen in the practiſe of all ſorts of good works. Yet is there not ſo much loue teſtified, neither in the abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor in the very deede doing, as in ſuffering.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:2765:286"/> Certes the holy-Ghoſt in the holy Scripture puts downe the death and paſsion which our Sauiour ſuffered for vs, as the higheſt ſtraine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Loue towards vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Firſt to loue Gods will in conſolations, is a good loue, when the loue of God is indeede loued, not the conſolation in which it is found: howbeit it is a loue voide of contradiction, repugnance and difficultie; for who would not loue a will ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in a ſubiect ſo wellcome? Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, to Loue the will of God in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſells, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is a ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d degree of loue and much more perfect: for it leades vs to the renouncing and quitting of our owne will, and makes vs abſtaine and forbeare many pleaſures, yet not all. Thirdly to loue ſufferances and afflictions for the loue of God, is the higheſt point of holy Charitie: for there is nothing therein to gaine our affection, ſaue the onely will of God; Our nature feeles a great contradiction in it, and we doe not thereby forſake pleaſures onely, but we euen e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brace paines and torments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our mortall enemye knew well, what was Loue's furtheſt tryall, when he had heard from the mouth of God, that IOB was iuſt, rightuous, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God, hatting ſinne, and ſtable in innocencie: he made no account of all this, in compariſon of bearing afflictions, by which he made the laſt and ſureſt eſſaye of the loue of this great ſeruant of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an extreamitie, he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them of the loſſe of all his goods, and all his children, of the entire reuolt of all his friends, and of an arrogant oppoſition of his greateſt Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,

               <p n="6">6. And yet behold the great IOB, as king of all the miſerable creaturs vpon the face of the earth ſeated vpon a dunge-hill, as vpon the Throne of miſerie; adorned with ſoares, vlcers, and matter, as with royall robes, ſuteing them in the qualitie of his royaltie, with ſo great an abiection and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, that if he had not ſpooken, one should not haue deſcerned, whether IOB was a man redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a dounghill, or the dounghill a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in forme of a man. Behold there, I ſaie, the great Iob, crying out, If we haue receiued good things from the hand of God, why shall we not alſo receiue that which is bad? ô God how this word is great with Loue! He ponders, THEO: that it was from the hand of God, that he had receiued the good, teſtifying that he had not ſo much loued good becauſe it was good, as that it came from our Sauiours hand: which being ſo, he concluds, that he is louingly to ſupport aduerſities, ſince they proceede from our Sauiours hand, equally to be loued when he diſtributs afflictions, and when he beſtowes conſolations. Each one doth eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good things, but to receiue euill, is a worke of perfect Loue, which loues them ſo much the more, for that they are not amiable, but in reſpect of his hand that giues them.</p>

But he that is ſure of his way, walks on iocundly, boldly and ſwiftly. Euen ſo the Loue that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The hounds in ſpring time, are euery foote at default finding hardly any ſent at all; becauſe the hearbes and flowres doe then ſmell ſo freshly, that the freshneſſe put downe the rowt or ſent of the Hart or hare; In the ſpring time of conſolations, Loue is ſcarcely acquainted with Gods pleaſure, becauſe the ſenſible pleaſure of the conſolation doth ſo allure the heart, that it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the attention which it ought to haue to the will of God. S. CATHARINE hauing from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour her choice of a Crowne of gold, or a crowne of thornes, chooſed this, as better ſuteting with Loue. A deſire of ſufferance, ſaieth the B.

               <p n="2">2. Now of all the eſſayes of perfect Loue, that which is practiſed by the repoſe of the mind in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall tribulations, is doubtleſſe the moſt pure, and higheſt. The B. ANGELA OF FOLIGNY makes an admirable deſcription of the interiour panges which ſometimes she felt, ſaying that her ſoule was tortured like to one who being tyed hand and foote, should be hung by the necke, without being ſtrangled, but should hang in this eſtate betwixt death and life, without hope of helpe, and neither being able to keepe herſelfe vpon her feete, nor
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:2765:288"/> aſsiſt herſelfe with her hands, nor crie out, nor yet ſigh or moane. So it faires, THEO: the ſoule is ſometimes ſo ouercharged with interiour affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that all her faculties and powers, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by priuation of all that might releiue her; and by apprehenſion and impreſsion, of all that might attriſtate her. So that at the imitation of her Sauiour she begins to be troubled, to feare, to be diſamayed, and at length to waxe ſad with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row like vnto that of one dying. Whence she may rightly ſaie, My ſoule is heauie euen to death: and with her whole hearts conſent, she deſirs, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſupplicats, that if it be poſsible, this Calice may paſſe, hauing nothing left her, ſaue the very ſupreame point of her Spirit, which cleeuing hard to the Diuine heart and will, ſaieth in a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſubmiſsion, O eternall Father, ah! not myne, but thy will be done. And, which is diligently to be noted, the ſoule makes this reſignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſuch a world of troubles, contradictions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnances, that she doth euen hardly perceiue that she makes it; at leaſt it ſeemes to her to be done ſo coldly, that it is not done from her heart, nor as it were fitting, ſince that which paſſeth there in fauour of the Diuine will, is not onely done without delight and contentment, but euen againſt the pleaſure and liking of all the reſt of the heart; whom loue permits to bemoane her ſelfe, at leaſt to moane that she cannot bemoane her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to ſigh out all the LAMENTATIONS of IOB and Hieremie: yet with charge, that a ſacred peace be ſtill conſerued in the very bottome of the heart in the higheſt and moſt delicate point of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:2765:289"/> and this ſubmiſsiue peace is not tender or ſweete, nor yet in a manner ſenſible, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſincere, ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, inuincible, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d full of Loue; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſeemes to haue betake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe to the very e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Spirit, as into the dungeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Fort, where it remaines corragious; though all the reſt be taken and preſſed with ſorrow: And by how much the more Loue in this caſe is depriued of all helpes, forſaken of all the aide of the vertues and faculties of the ſoule, by ſo much it is more to be priſed for conſeruing conſtantly its fidelitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This vnion or conformitie to the diuine pleaſure, is made either by a holy reſignation, or a moſt holy indifferencie. Now Reſignation is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, with a certaine force and ſubmiſsion: one would willingly liue in lieu of dying, yet ſince it is Gods pleaſure that die we muſt, we yeeld to it. We would willingly liue, if it pleaſed God, yea further, we would willingly that it were his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to prolong life: we die willingly, yet more willingly would we liue; we departe with a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable good will, yet would we ſtay with a better. IOB in his afflictions made an act of reſignation: ſince we haue receiued the good, ſaied he, from the hand of God, why shall we not ſuſtaine the the toyles and vexations which he doth ſend vs? marke, THEO: how he ſpeakes of ſuſtaining, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, enduring; as it hath pleaſed our Lord, ſo was it done, our Lords name be praiſed. Theſe are the words of reſignation and acceptance, by way of ſufferance and patience.</p>

REſignation preferrs Gods will before all things, yet doth it Loue many other things beſides the will of God: but Indifferencie paſſeth Reſignation: for it Loues nothing, but meerely for the Loue of Gods will: in ſo much that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all can ſtirre the indifferent heart, in the preſence of the will of God. True it is, the moſt indifferent heart in the world may be touched with ſome affection, while yet it diſcouers not where the will of God is. Eliezer being come to the fountaine of Hara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had a full view of the virgin Rebecca, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without doubt, ſaw her too too faire and pleaſing: howbeit he ſtaied himſelfe in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, till he knew by a ſigne from God, that the Diuine will had ordained her a wife for his Maiſters ſonne: for then he preſented her with the eare-iewels, and bracelets of gold. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe if IACOB had onely loued in Rachel the alliance with Laban, to which his Father Iſaac had obliged him, Lya had bene as deare vnto him as Rachel, they being doth Labans daughters; and conſequently his Fathers will had bene as well ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the one as in the other. But becauſe beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his Fathers will he coueted to ſatisfie his owne liking, taken with the beautie and louelineſſe of
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:2765:290"/> Rachel, he was troubled to Eſpouſe LYA, yet by reſignation, tooke her againſt his owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the indifferent heart ſtands not thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, for knowing that tribulation though she be hard-fauered as another LYA, leaues not for all that to be daughter and a beloued one to the Diuine Pleaſure, it loues her as much as conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet in it ſelfe is more gracious, yea it Loues tribulation more, for that it ſees nothing amiable in it, ſauing the ſigne of Gods will. If pure water onely be my deſire, what care I whether it be ſerued vp in a golden bolle, or in a glaſſe, ſince, I am to haue the water onely; yea I would rather haue it in a glaſſe, becauſe it hath no other colour then that of the water, which alſo I haue at a fairer view. What doth import whether Gods will be preſented vnto vs in tribulation or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, ſince I pretend nothing in either of them, but Gods will, which appears ſo much the better, in that there appears, no other beautie, then that of the eternall pleaſure?</p>

Wherein he was followed by the great Bishop S.

Admirable was the indifferencie of the Apoſtle, admirable that of this Apoſtolicall man. They ſee heauen ſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for them, in earth a thouſand toyles, they are indifferent in the choice of either, nothing but the will of God can conterpoiſe their hearts. Heauen appears no more pleaſant then worldly miſeries, ſo Gods GOOD PLEASVRE be equally in them both. Labours are a heauen to them, if Gods will be found in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and heauen is a Hell if it be not found therein: for as Dauid ſaieth, they deſire not any thing in heauen or earth, but that Gods GOOD PLEASVRE might be accomplished. O Lord what is there in heauen for me, or what can I deſire in earth ſaue thyne owne ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The indifferent heart is as a balle of waxe in
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:2765:291"/> the hands of its God, readie to receiue all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of the Diuine pleaſure. It is a heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſpoſed to all, hauing no other obiect of its will, then the will of its God, which doth not place its affection vpon the things that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but vpon the will of God that willeth them. Wherevpon when it meetes with Gods will in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things, it chooſeth that, coſt what it will, wherein it appeares moſt. Gods will is found in marriage, and in virginitie, but becauſe it is more in virginitie, the indifferent heart makes choice of virginitie though it should coſt her her life, as it did S.

Gods will is found in ſeruing as well the poore as the rich, but yet ſomwhat more in ſeruing the poore; the indifferent heart will chooſe that part. God's will is in modeſtie exerciſed in conſolations, and in patience practiſed in tribulations; the indifferent heart preferres this, as hauing more of Gods will in it. To conclud Gods will is the ſoueraigne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſoule.

               <p n="1">1. Indifferencie is to be practiſed in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the naturall life, as in health, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beautie, deformitie, weackneſſe and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: in the affaires of the ſpirituall life as in honours, place, riches; In the varietie of the ſpirituall life, as in drineſſes, conſolations, guſts, aridities: In actions, in ſufferances, and finally in all ſorts of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents. Iob, in his naturall life, was wounded with a moſt horrible ſoare that euer eye beheld. In his ciuile life, he was ſcorned, baffled, contemned, and that by his nereſt allie: In his ſpirituall life, he was oppreſſed with languors, gripings, conuulſions, andguishes, darkneſſe, and with all kinds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable interiour aggreeua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints and Lamentations doe witeneſſe. The great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth denounce vnto vs a generall indifferencie to shew our ſelues the true ſeruants of God, in wants, anguishes, wounds, in priſons, ſeditions, trauailles, in watchings, faſtings, in chaſtitie, in knowledge, in longanimitie, and ſweeteneſſe, in vertue of the holy Ghoſt, in vnfained Charitie, in the word of truth, in the vertue of God, by the armes of Iuſtice, to the right and left hand, by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:2765:292"/> and abiection, by infamie and good name; as ſeductours and yet iuſt, as men vnknowen, and yet acknowledged, as men dying and yet aliue, as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed and yet not ſlaine, as ſorrowfull, and yet ſtill continually ioyefull, as needie and yet enriching many, as hauing nothing and yet poſſeſsing all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note I pray you, THEO: how the life of the Apoſtles, in their bodies, was afflicted with wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: in their hearts with anguishes: in their ciuile life, by infamie and priſons; and in all theſe ô God what indifferencie they had! Their ſorrows are ioyfull, their pouertie rich, their death liuely, their dishonours honorable: that is, they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be ſad, content to be poore, reenforced to liue amongſt the dangers of death, and glorious to be diſeſteemed; for ſuch was the will of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And whereas the will of God was better knowen in ſufferances, then in the acts of other vertues, he rankes the exerciſe of patience in the front, ſaying, let vs appeare in all things the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, by great patience in tribulations, in wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in anguishes: and then towards th'end, in chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in Prudence, in longanimitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In like manner our heauenly Sauiour was incomparably afflicted in his ciuile life, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as guiltie of Treaſon againſt God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bet, buffetted, ſcourged; and in his naturall life torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with an extraordinarie ignominie, dying in the moſt cruell and ſenſible torments that heart could thinke. In his ſpirituall life, enduring ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, feares, amazements, anguishes, ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:2765:292"/> interiour oppreſsions, ſuch as neuer was or shall be. For though the ſupreame portion of his ſoule did ſoueraignely enioye eternall glorie, yet would not Loue let glorie ſpred its delightes, neither in his ſenſe, imagination or inferiour rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but left the whole heart expoſed in this ſort, to the mercy of ſorrow and diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Ezechiel had a viſion of a picture of a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which tooke him by an onely locke of his head-haire, and hoiſt him vp into the aire. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our Sauiour reared vp into the aire vpon the Croſſe, ſeemed to be held in his Fathers hand, by the very extreamitie of the Spirit, and as it were, by one haire of his head, which being touched by the ſweete hand of his eternall Father, receiued a ſoueraigne abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Felicitie, all the reſt being drunke vp in ſorrow and griefe. Wherevpon he cries out, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſaie, that the fish termed the Lanterne of the Sea, in the midſt of the tempeſt, thruſts her tongue out of the water, which is ſo bright, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cleare that she ſerue the marriners for light-houſes, or Beacons; ſo in the midſt of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherewith our Sauiour was beſet, all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule were ſwallowed vp, and buried in the torment of ſuch a number of paines, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely the point of his Spirit, which being free from all paine, remained bright and light with glorie and felicitie. O how bleſſed is the Loue which raignes in the top of a faithfull ſoule, while it is toſſed vpon the billowes and waues of interiour tribulations.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Scarcely can we diſcouer the Diuine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure but by the euents, and as long as it is vnknowen vnto vs, we muſt adheare cloſe to the will of God which is alreadie declared and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto vs: but as ſoone as the Diuine Maieſties pleaſure appeares, we muſt preſently and louingly ſubmit our ſelues vnto it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My mother, or my ſelfe (all is one) are ſicke in bed, what doe I know, whether it be his will, that death should enſue? verily I am ignorant of it; yet know I well, that in the interim, till the euent arriue, he hath ordained by his ſignified will, that I vſe meanes conuenient for the cure. I will therefore faithfully doe myne endeauour, not omitting any thing that I can well contribute to that effect. But if it be the Diuine pleaſure, that the remedies should not preuaile againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which brings death with it; as ſoone as I shall haue intelligence thereof by the euent, I will lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly yeeld to it, in the point of my heart maugre all the oppoſition of the inferiour powers of my ſoule. I, Lord, will I ſaie, it is my will, becauſe thy GOOD PLEASVRE is ſuch: ſo it hath pleaſed thee, and ſo it shall pleaſe me, who am the moſt humble ſeruant of thy will.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:2765:293"/>3. But if the Diuine pleaſure were declared vnto me, before the euent thereof, as was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his death to the great S. Peter: to the great S.

                  </gap> to the will of God, who beleeuing that it was the Diuine pleaſure that he should ſacrifice his child, willed and enterpriſed it ſo couragiouſly! Admirable that of the child, who ſo meekely ſubmited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his Fathers ſword, to haue Gods will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, at the price of his owne blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But note here, THEO: a marke of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnion of an indifferent heart with the Diuine pleaſure: behold Abraham with the ſword in his hand, his arme extended, readie to lend death's-blow to his onely deare So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: this he did to pleaſe the Diuine pleaſure: and ſee at the ſame inſtant an Angell, who of the part of the ſaied Pleaſure, ſodainely ſtops him, and preſently, he waighes his blow, equally readie to ſacrifice or not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his ſonne, his life and death being all one to him, in the preſence of Gods will. When God giues him order to ſacrifice his Sonne, he is not ſorrowfull; when he diſpenſeth with the order giuen, he is not ioyfull. All is one to this reſolute heart, ſo Gods will be done.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yes, THEO: for God oftentimes to exerciſe
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:2765:294"/> vs in this holy indifferencie, inſpires vs with high deſignes, which yet he will not haue accomplished and as then we are boldly, couragiouſly and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſet vpon and purſue the worke to our power; ſo are we ſweetly and quietly to ſubmit our ſelues to the euent of our entrepriſe, ſuch as it pleaſeth God to ſend vs. S. LEWES by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſſed the Sea, to conquer the holy Land, the ſucceſſe anſwered not his expectation, he ſweetly ſubmitted hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe to it. I doe more eſteeme the tranquillitie of this ſubmiſsion, then the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie of his enterpriſe. S. FRANCIS went into Egipt to conuert the infidels, or amongſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels to die a Martyre, ſuch was the will of God, yet he returned without performing of either, and that was alſo Gods will. It was alſo the will of God, that S. ANTONIE of Padua both deſired Martyrdome, and obtained it not. The B. Ignatius of Loyola, hauing with ſuch paines put on foote the Companie of the name of IESVS, whereof he ſaw ſo faire fruit, and foreſaw much more in the tyme to come, durſt yet promiſe himſelfe, that, though he should ſee it diſſolued, which was the sharpeſt diſpleaſure that could befall him, with in halfe an houre after he would be reſigned and appeaſe himſelfe in the will of God. Iohn Auila, that holy and learned Preacher of Andaluſia, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a deſigne to erect a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of reformed Prieſts for the aduancement of Gods glorie, wherein he had alreadie made a good ſtep, as ſoone as he ſaw that of the Ieſuites on foote, which he thought did ſuffice for that time, he preſently ſtopt his deſigne, with an incomparable meeckneſſe and humilitie.
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:2765:294"/> O how happie are ſuch ſoules, as are couragious, and forceable in the enterpriſes to which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them; and withall tractable and facile in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them ouer, when God doth ſo diſpoſe. Theſe are markes of a moſt perfect indifferencie, to leaue of doing a good, when God pleaſeth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne in the halfe way, when Gods will, which is our Guide, doth ordaine it. Ionas was much to blame, to ſuſpect that God did not accomplish his Propheſie vpon the NINIVITS; Ionas performed Gods will, in denouncing vnto the Niniuits their ouerthrowe, but he let his owne will and intereſt enter into the worke, wherevpon ſeeing that God did not fulfill his prediction according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the letter, he was offended, and murmured vnworthily. Whereas, if Gods will had bene the onely motiue of his actions, he would haue bene as well content to haue ſeene it accomplished, in remiſsion of the paine which the Niniuits had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, as in punishments of the fault, which the Niniuits had comitted. Our deſire is that the things which we vndertake, or haue a finger in, should ſucceede well, but there is no reaſon, that God should doe all that we deſire. If Gods will be that Niniuie should be threatned, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not throwen downe, ſince the threat is ſufficient to correct, why should Ionas find himſelfe ageeeued in it?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if this be ſo, we are then to affect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but abandone our buſineſſe to the mercy of the euents. Pardon me, THEO: we are to omit nothing, which is requiſite to bring the worke, which God hath put into our hands to a
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:2765:295"/> happie iſſue; yet vpon condition, that if the euent be contrarie, we should louingly and peaceably embrace it: for we are commanded to be iealous in that which appertaines to God's glorie, and to our office: but we are neither obliged, nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the euent which is not placed within our reach. Take care of him, was it ſaied to the Groome of the ſtable, in the Parable of the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who lay halfe dead betwixt Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico: It is not ſaied, as S. Bernard remarkes, cure him, but take care of him. So the Apoſtles, with an vnſpeakable affection, preached firſt to the Iewes, though they foreſaw that in the end they they should be forced to leaue them, and betake themſelues to the Gentils. It is our part to plant and water carefully, but it belongs to God onely, to giue encreaſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The great Pſalmiſt makes this praier to our Sauiour, as in an exclamation of ioye, and with preſage of victorie. O Lord, for thy beautie and comlineſſe ſake, bend thy bow, march proſperou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and get on horſe back; as though he too would ſaie, that by the arrowes of his heauenly Loue, shot into humane hearts, he made himſelfe Maiſter of man, to handle him at his pleaſure, not vnlike to a horſe well trained vp. O Lord thou art the Royall MAISTER OF THE HORSE, who can turne the heart of thy faithfull Louers into all poſtures, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giuing them full bridle, they runne at full ſpeede in the enterpriſes to which they were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againe, at thy pleaſure, thou ſtopeſt them in the midſt of their careere, and at the hight of their ſpeede.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:2765:295"/>8. But further, if the enterpriſe begun by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, doe perish by his fault, into whoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it was put in truſt, how can one ſaie then, that a man is to ſubmit himſelfe to Gods will? for ſome will ſaie vnto me, it is not Gods will that hinders the euent, but my fault, which is not cauſed by Gods will. It is true, my child, thy fault was not cauſed by Gods will; for God is not Authour of ſinne: yet it is alſo true, that it is Gods will that thy fault, is followed with the defect and ouerthow of thy deſigne, in punishment of thy fault: for though his goodneſſe cannot permit him to will thy fault, yet can his Iuſtice permit the paine due to it. So God was not the cauſe that Dauid offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet he inflicted vpon him the paine due to his ſinne. Nor was he the cauſe of Sauls ſinne; Marrie he was cauſe that in punishment of it, the victorie perished in his hands.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When therefore it happens, that in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our fault, our holy deſignes haue not good euents; we muſt equally by a ſolide repentance deteſt the fault, and accept the punishments thereof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. GOd hath ordained that we should imploy our whole endeauours to obtaine the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:2765:296"/> holy vertues. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forget nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which might helpe our good ſucceſſe in this pious entrepriſe: but after we haue once planted, and watered, let's then know for certaine, that it is God, which muſt giue groth to the trees of our good inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and habits. And therefore, from his Diuine Prouidence we are to expect the fruits of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d labours. And if we perceiue not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and aduancement of our hearts in deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch as we would deſire it, let's not be troubled at it, let's liue in peace, let a ſmooth calme alwayes raigne in our hearts. It belongs to vs, diligently to labour our heart, and therefore we muſt faithfully attend to it: But touching the plentie of the croppe or haruiſt, let's leaue the care thereof to our Lord and Maiſter. The Husbandman is neuer reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the harueſt is not plentifull; but onely that he did not carefully till and ſowe his ground. Let's not be troubled to perceiue our ſelues conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually NOVICES in the exerciſe of vertue: for in the MONASTERIE OF A DEVOTE LIFE, euery one holds himſelfe a continuall NOVICE; and there, the whole life, is the yeare of PROBATION, there being no more euident argument, not onely that we are NOVICES, but that we are euen worthy of expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and reprobation, then to eſteeme and hold our ſelues PROFESSED. For according to the Rule of this Order, not the ſolemnitie, but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the vowes, makes the Nouices Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; nor are the vowes euer performed, while there remaines yet ſomething to be done for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; nor is the obligation of ſeruing God, and going on in his loue ended, but with the end
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:2765:296"/> of life. I but, will ſome ſay vnto me, if I know that it is by my owne fault, that I profited not in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, how could I but be greeued and diſquieted? I haue ſaied the ſame in the Introduction to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote life, but I doe willingly iterate it, becauſe it can neuer be ſaied ſufficiently, one muſt be ſorrie for faultes committed, with a ſetled, conſtant, and calme repentance, but not with ſuch an one as is diſtempered, turbulent, or diſencouraging. Are you ſure that your backwardneſſe in vertue was cauſed by your fault? goe to then, humble your ſelfe before God, implore his Mercy, fall proſtrate before the face of his goodneſſe, and demand par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, confeſſe your fault, crie him mercy, euen in your Ghoſtly Fathers eare, to obtaine abſolation: But this being done remaine in peace, and hauing deteſted the offence, embrace louingly the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, which you feele in your ſelfe, by reaſon of delaying your aduancement in vertue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Alas, THEO: the ſoules in Purgatorie, are there doubtleſſe for their ſinnes, and for ſinnes which they haue deteſted, and doe highly deteſt: but as for the abiection and paine which remaines, to be tyed to that place, and to be depriued for a ſpace of the beloued Loue of heauen, they endure it with Loue, and deuotely pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Canticle of the Diuine Iuſtice; Thou art iuſt ô Lord, and thy iudgments are rightuous. Let's therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our aduancement with patience, and in ſteede of diſquieting our ſelues that we haue ſo little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the time paſt, let vs diligently endeuour to doe better in the time to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behold, I beſeech you this good ſoule, she
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:2765:297"/> hath much deſired and endeauored to infranchish her ſelfe of choler, wherein God hath aſsiſted her: for he hath quite deliuered her from all the ſinns which proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> choler, she would die rather then vtter one onely iniurious word, or to let ſlipe any showe of hatred. And yet she is ſubiect to the aſſaults, and firſt motions of this paſsion, which are certaine iertings, ſtirrings, and ſallies of an angrie mind, termed in the Caldaicall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, SHRVGGINGS, ſaying shrugge, but ſinne not: whereas our ſacred verſion ſaieth; Be angrie, but ſinne not; which in effect is the ſame thing: for the Prophet would onely ſaie, that if anger ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe vs, ſtirring vp in our hearts the firſt shrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of ſinne, we should be carefull not to let our ſelues be carried further into the paſsion, for ſo we should offend: and though theſe firſt ſtirrings and shruggings be no ſinne, yet the poore ſoule that is oft ſet hard at by them, doth trouble, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſquiſquiet herſelfe, reputing her ſorrow a ſacrifice to God, as though it were the Loue of God that prouoked her to this ſorrow. And yet, THEO: it is not heauenly Loue that cauſeth this trouble; it neuer being offended but at ſinne; it is ſelfe-Loue that deſires to be freed from the paines and toyles, which the aſſaults of anger drawes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Nor is it the offence that offends vs in theſe ſtirrings of anger, there being none at all commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: it is the paine we are put to in reſiſting, that diſquiets vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe rebellions of the ſenſuall appetite, as well iraſcible, as concupiſcible, are left in vs for our exerciſe, to th'end we might practiſe ſpirituall

They are they Philiſtians, againſt whom the true Iſraelits are ſtill to fight, but shall neuer put them to flight; they may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them but neuer quite ouerthrow them. They liue with vs, and neuer die but with vs. They are truly execrable and deteſtable, as being bred by ſinne, and fed of ſinne, whence, as we are termed earth, becauſe we take our deſcent from earth, and to earth runne back againe, ſo this rebellion is named ſinne by the great Apoſtle, as being iſſue of ſinne and drawing ſtill that wayward, though it neuer makes vs guiltie, vnleſſe we ſecond, and obey it; wherevpon the ſame Apoſtle doth exhort vs, that we permit it not to raigne in our mortall bodie, to be ſubiect vnto it. He prohibits vs not to feele: but onely not to conſent to it. He doth not ordaine, that we should hinder ſinne to enter into vs, but he commands, that it should not raigne in vs: It is in vs when we feele the rebellion of the ſenſuall appetite, but it doth not raigne in vs, vnleſſe we giue conſent vnto it. The Phiſitian will neuer giue order that the ſicke of an ague should not be drie, for that were too great a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, marrie he will tell him, that though he be drie, he muſt abſtaine from drinking. No man will be ſo mad, as to bid a woman with child, longe for no extrauagant things, for it is not in her power; well may one deſire her to diſcouer her longings, to th'end that if she longes for hurtfull things, one might diuert her imagination, leaſt the phantaſie might get dominion ouer her heart.</p>

So our hearts in the beginning of deuotion, loue God that they may be vnited, and become gratefull vnto him, and imitate him in that he hath loued vs for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: but by little and little being formed, and exerciſed in holy Loue, they are imperceptibly changed, and in lieu of louing God, to pleaſe God, they begin to Loue him for the pleaſure they take in the exerciſes of holy Loue, and inſteede of falling in Loue with God, they fall in Loue with the Loue they beare him, and ſtand affected to their owne affections, not taking any more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in God, but in the pleaſure they take in his Loue; contenting themſelues with this Loue, becauſe it is theirs, that it is in their heart, whence it proceedes: for though this ſacred Loue be called the Loue of God, becauſe God is loued by it, yet it is alſo ours, we being the Louers that

Of two Canticles which are both Diuine, the one may be ſung, becauſe it is Diuine: and the other, becauſe it is pleaſing; Rachell and Lya, were equally Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs wiues, but he Loues the one onely in the qualitie of a wife: the other, in that she was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. The Canticle is Diuine, but the motiue which moues vs to ſing it, is the ſpirituall delight which we pretend therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doe you not ſee, will ſome ſaie to this or that Bishop, that it is Gods will that you should ſing the Paſtorall ſong of his Loue, amongſt your flocke, which he commands you thrice to feede in vertue of holy Loue, in the perſon of the great S. Peter, the firſt head of Paſtours? What will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me? That at Rome, or Paris there is more ſpirituall delight, and that there, one may practiſe Diuine Loue with more comfort. O God it is not then to pleaſe thee that this partie deſires to ſing, it is for the pleaſure he takes in it; He ſeekes not thee in his Loue, but the contentment which he receiues in the exerciſe of the ſame loue. Religious men would ſing the Paſtours ſong, and married men that which belongs to the Religious, and all this ſaie they, to Gods greater glorie. Ah, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your ſelues my friends, doe not ſaie that you doe it to Gods greater glorie. O God no! it is done for your owne greater content; which you preferre before Gods. Gods will is equally, and almoſt ſtill more in ſickneſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in health.

The very ſolicitude we haue, not to be diſtracted, is often times a maine diſtraction: Simplicitie in ſpirituall actions is moſt commendable. Deſire you to behold God, doe ſo then, and be attentiue to that: for if you goe to reflect and bring your eyes backwards vpon your ſelfe, to ſee how you looke when you looke vpon him, it is not now him that you behold, but your owne geſture, your ſelfe. He that praies feruently, knowes not whether he praies or not; for he
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:2765:303"/> thinks not of the Praier which he makes, but of God, to whom he makes it. He that is in the heate of ſacred Loue, doth not turne his heart vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to looke what he is doing, but keepes it hard ſet, and bent vpon God, to whom he applies his Loue. The heauenly Chaunter takes ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in pleaſing God, that he hath no pleaſure in the melodie of his voice, but onely in reſpect that God is pleaſed in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why, in your opinion Theo: did Amon the ſonne of Dauid Loue Thamar ſo deſperately, that he euen thought to die for Loue? Doe you thinke that it was her that he loued? You shall ſee that he did not: for as ſoone as he had glutted his execrable luſt, he cruelly kick'ed her out of dores, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ignominiouſly reiected her. If it had bene thamar that he loued, he had neuer done this; for Thamar remained ſtill Thamar: but whereas it was not Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar that he loued, but the brutall delight which he tooke in her, as ſoone as he had got what he ſought for, Thamar was outragiouſly bet, and brutally treated by him. His pleaſure was placed vpon Thamar, but his Loue was ſet vpon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not vpon Thamar. So that the pleaſure being ended he could alſo willingly haue procured an end of her. THEO: you shall ſee ſome praying, as you would thinke, with great deuotion and feruour in the practiſe of heauenly Loue: but ſtay a little, and you shall diſcouer whether it be God indeede that he loueth. Alas, as ſoone as the delight and ſatisfaction which he tooke in Loue shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and a drineſſe shall arriue, he will quite leaue of all, and praie onely curſarily by fits. Now if it
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:2765:303"/> had bene God indeede that he loued, why would he haue left louing him, ſince God is ſtill God: it was therefore God's conſolation that he loued, not the God of conſolation. Truly there are diuers that take no delight in Diuine Loue, vnleſſe it be canded in the ſuggur of ſome ſenſible ſweeteneſſe, and they doe willingly plaie the children, who, if they haue a little honie ſpred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theit bread doe licke and ſucke off the honie, caſting the bread away: for if the delight could be ſeparated from the Loue, they would reiect Loue, and licke vp the delight onely. Wherefore following Loue for Loue of the delight, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they meete not with delight, they forſake Loue. And, ô God, to what eminent danger are thoſe people expoſed, either to returne backe againe as ſoone as they miſſe thoſe guſts and conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or else to be occupied in vaine delight farre remote from true Loue, and to miſtake the honie of Heraclea for that of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone?</p>

Propoſe vnto your ſelfe, THEOT: the glorious and neuer ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prayſed S.

She would alſo
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:2765:308"/> haue made anſwere, he told me in generall, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I care not for knowing that, deſiring onely to accompanie him. And if one had replied, why then Madame, you haue no deſigne in this iorney; No, would she haue ſaied, I haue no other but to be with my deare Soueraigne and husband. Why, but might one haue ſaied vnto her, he goes into Egipte, to paſſe into PALESTINE, he will lodge at DAMIETA in ACREA, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in many places beſids; doe not you intend Madame, to goe thither to? To this she would haue made anſwere: no in truth I haue no intention, ſaue onely to keepe my ſelfe neere my King, as for the places whither he goes, they are all indifferent to me, nor doe they enter into my thoughts, but in ſo much as he shall be there; I goe without deſire of going, for I affect nothing but the Kings preſence. It is therefore the King that goes, he that deſignes the iorney; but as for me, I goe not, I followe onely: I deſire not the iorney, but the onely preſence of the King: to goe or to ſtaie, and all ſorts of contrarietie, being indifferent to me.</p>

Certes if one demand of a ſeruant that is of his Maiſters traine, whither he goes: he is not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he is to goe to ſuch or ſuch a place, but onely that he is to follow his Maiſter; for he goes no where vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne accord, but at his Maiſters pleaſure onely. In like manner, THEO: a will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſigned to God's, is not to haue any will of her owne, but is ſimply to follow God's. And as one in a Shipe, doth not moue by his owne motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but leaues himſelfe to be moued by the Motion of the Veſſell in which he is, ſo the heart, that is
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:2765:309"/> embarked in the diuine pleaſure, ought to haue no other will then that of permitting it ſelfe to be conducted by the Diuine will. And then the heart doth not, as before, ſaie, thy will be done not myne, for there is now no will to be renounced; but it pronounceth theſe words, Lord, I put my will into thy hands, euen as though it had not its will in its owne diſpoſing: but at the diſpoſition of the Diuine prouidence; So that it is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this manner that Seruants follow their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for albeit the iorney be vndertaken at their Maiſters pleaſure, yet is their following perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by their owne particular will, by a will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that is follower, ſeruant, ſubiect, and thraule to the will of their Maiſter. So that as the Maiſter a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are two, ſo the will of the Maiſter and the will of the ſeruant are alſo two. But the will which is dead to her ſelfe, that she may liue to Gods, is without any particular will, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not onely conformable and ſubiect, but euen annihilated in herſelfe to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into Gods: as one might ſaie of a little child, who hath not yet got the vſe of his will, to Loue or deſire any thing, ſaue the vſe of his deare mothers breaſtes: for he decernes not of which ſide he would rather be, or any other thing elſe, except onely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his mothers treſſes, with whom he eſteemes himſelfe one ſame thing; neuer troubling himſelfe how he should conforme his will to his mothers: for he perceiues not his owne, nor doth he think, he hath any, leauing all the care to his mother, to goe, to doe, and to will what she iudgeth profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for him.</p>

And though she permitted him now and then to ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne a foote by her, weelding him by the hand, yet was it not, that she would not rather haue had him ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about her necke and breaſts; but it was to teach him to forme his ſteps, and walke alone. And we, THEO: as the little children of the heauenly Father, may walke with him in two ſorts: for we may either take the ſteps of our owne will, which
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:2765:310"/> we conforme to his, holding alwayes in the hand of our obedience his Diuine intention, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it whereſoeuer it shall leade vs, which God requires at our hands by the ſignification of his will: for ſince his will is that I should doe his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance, his will is alſo that I haue a will to doe it. God hath ſignified vnto me that his will is, I should keepe holy the Saboth day, ſince therefore he will haue me to doe it, he will alſo that I haue a will to doe it, and for this end that I haue a will of myne owne, by which I follow his, by correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondance and conformitie. But we may alſo walke with our Sauiour, without any will of our owne, by caſting our ſelues ſimply vpon the Diuine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as a little child in his mothers armes, by a certaine admirable kind of conſent, which may be termed VNION, or rather vnitie of our heart with Gods. And this is the way that we are to endeuour to comport our ſelues in GODS WILL OF GOOD PLEASVRE, for ſo much as the effects of this WILL OF GOOD PLEASVRE, doe proceede purely from his Prouidence and doe come vnto vs without our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. True it is we may deſire their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, and this is a good deſire; yet we may alſo receiue the euents of Heauens good pleaſure, by a moſt ſimple tranquillitie of our will, while willing nothing, we doe in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of heart giue way to all that God would haue done in vs, on vs, or by vs.</p>

I leaue her the care as well to goe, as to will to goe for me, where she likes beſt. and as I goe not hut by her gate; ſo I will not but by her will: And from the inſtant I was firſt in her armes, I neuer gaue my attention either to will or nill, turning all other cares ouer to my mother, ſaue onely the care to liue in her boſome, to ſucke her ſacred Pappe, and to keepe my ſelfe cloſe ioyned to her amiable necke, louing to kiſſe her with kiſſes of my mouth. And be it knowen vnto you, that while I am amongſt the delights, of theſe holy huggings which ſurpaſſe all delights; I apprehend my mother as a tree of life, and my ſelfe in her, as the fruit; that I am her owne heart in the midſt of her heart, or her ſoule in the heart of her heart, ſo that as her gate ſerues both her and me without my touching the ground; ſo her will ſerues vs both without producing any act of my will, about the buſineſſe of going and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Sauiour of our ſoules was endewed with the vſe of Reaſon, from the inſtant of his Conception in his mothers wombe, and could make all theſe diſcourſes: yea euen the glorious S. IOHN his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner from the day of his holy Viſitation. And though both of them, as well in that time, as in their infancie, were poſſeſſed of proper libertie to will or not to will; yet did they deferre the care of that which concerned their exteriour gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their mothers, to doe and will for them what was requiſite.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such should we be, THEO: pliable and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to Gods good Pleaſure, as though we were very waxe, not giuing our thoughts leaue to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in wishing and willing any thing, but leauing it to God to will and doe all for vs according to his goodneſſe throwing vpon him all our ſollicitude, becauſe he hath care of vs, as the holy Apoſtle ſaieth; and note that he ſaieth: All our ſollicitudes that is, as well thoſe which concerne the euents, as thoſe, which pertaine to willing or not willing: for he will haue a care of the iſſue of our affaires, and of willing that which is beſt for vs.</p>

The daughter of an excellent Phiſitian and Surgeon, being in a continuall Ague and knowing that she was tenderly beloued of her Father, ſaied to one of her friends, I endure a great paine, yet thinke I of no remedies: for I know not what would be apt to worke the Cure. I might wish for one thing, while an other were more conuenient. Were it not therefore my faireſt way to leaue all this care to my Father, who knowes what to doe, can, and will doe all that is required for my health? I were to blame if I should trouble my ſelfe to thinke of it, ſince he will be carefull enough to thinke of it for me: I should erre to deſire any thing, ſith he is dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough to deſire all that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be profitable for me: I will therefore expect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till he will that which he deames fit, and will not otherwiſe buſie my ſelfe then in fixing myne eyes vpon him when he comes nigh me, to teſtifie vnto him my filiall affection, and to diſcouer vnto him my perfect confidence; and with this she fell a

Art thou fallen into the ſnares of aduerſitie? ah looke not vpon this mishape, nor vpon the Gyues wherein thou art caught? looke vpon God, and leaue all to him, he will haue care of thee, throwe thy thoughtes vpon him, and he will nourrish thee. Why doſt thou trouble thy ſelfe with willing or nilling the euents and accidents of this world, ſince thou art ignorant what were beſt for thee to will, and that God will will for thee, without thy trouble, all that thou art to will for thy ſelfe. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect therefore in peace of mind the effect of the Diuine pleaſure; and let his willing ſuffice thee, ſince he can neuer ceaſe to be good: For ſo he gaue order to his well beloued S. Catharine of Sienna, Thinke of me quoth he to her, and I will thinke for thee. It is a hard thing to expreſſe to the full, this extreame indifferencie of mans heart, which is ſo reduced to, and dead in the will of God: for it is not to be ſaied, me thinkes, that she doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit herſelfe to Gods ſubmiſſion, being an act of the ſoule declaring her conſent, nor is it to be ſaied that she doth accept or receiue it; for as much as accepting, or receiuing are certaine actions,

And therefore, me thinke, the ſoule in this indifferecie, that willeth nothing, but leaues God to will what he pleaſeth, is to be ſaied to haue her will in a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expectation; ſince that to expect, is not to doe, or act; but onely to remaine expoſed to ſome euer. And if you marke it, the expectation of the ſoule is altogether voluntarie, and yet an action it is not, but a meere diſpoſition to receiue whatſoeuer shall happen: and as ſoone as the euents are once arriued and receiued, the expectation becomes a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment or repoſe; Marry till they happen, in truth the ſoule is A PVRE EXPECTATION, indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to all that it shall pleaſe the Diuine will to ordaine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In this ſort did our Sauiour expreſſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame ſubmiſsion of his humane will to the will of his eternall Father. The Almightie, ſaieth he, hath opened myne eare, that is, he hath declared vnto me his pleaſure, touching the multitude of torments which I am to endure, and I, ſaieth he afterwards, doe not gaineſaie or withdraw my ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what would this ſaie, I doe not gaineſaie, or withdraw my ſelfe, but this, my will is in a ſimple expectation, and is readie for all that God shall ſend; In ſequele whereof I deliuer vp and abandone my bodie, to the mercy of ſuch as will beate it, and my cheekes to ſuch as will make them ſmart, being prepared to let them exerciſe their pleaſure

For as the faire Iudith reſerued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, her coſtly feſtiuall robes in her Cabinet, and yet placed not her affection vpon them, nor yet euer wore them in the time of her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

THEO: not onely of ſuch as loue God with all their heart, ſome loue him more, and ſome leſſe, but euen one and the ſame doth oft paſſe himſelfe, in this ſoueraigne exerciſe of louing God aboue all things. Appelles did at ſometimes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle his Pencell better then at others, ſometimes euen out ſtriping himſelfe: For though commonly he put all his art and all his attention to draw out ALEXANDER THE GREAT, yet did he neuer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye it ſo totally and entirely that he had not yet other tricks of art, by which though he neither put to't more skill, nor more affection, yet he did it more liuely and perfectly: He alwayes imployed all his wit to the good performance of this Table of ALEXANDER, becauſe he vſed it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, yet ſometimes he did it with more grace and felicitie. Who knowes not that we make progreſſe in this holy Loue, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the end of Saints is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a more perfect loue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their beginning.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now according to the phraſe of holy Scripture; to doe a thing with all ones heart, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports onely, to doe it willingly and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. O Lord ſaieth Dauid I haue ſought thee with all my heart, Lord heare me, and the holy WORD teſtifieth, that he had truely followed God with his whole heart: and yet not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:2765:321"/> all that, it affirmes alſo that Ezechias had not his equall amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt all the kings of Iuda, neither before nor after him; that he was vnited to God, and ſtraied not from him: Afterwards treating of IOSIAS, it ſaieth, that he had not his fellow amongſt all the kings either before or after hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God with all his heart, with all his ſoule, with all his force, according to the whole law of MOYSES: nor did there any that followed him, riſe like vnto him Marke then I praie you THEO: marke how DAVID, EZECHIAS, and IOSIAS loued GOD with all their hearts; and yet not all three with an equall dilection, becauſe ſome of them had not their like in this Loue, as the Sacred Text witneſſed. All the three loued him; each of them with all their heart, yet did nere a one of them ſeperatly, nor all three ioyntly, Loue him totally, but euery one in his particular way: ſo that as all the three were a like, in this, that they gaue their whole heart, ſo were they vnlike, in their manner of deliuering it: yea there is no doubt at all but that DAVID taken a part, was farre different from himſelfe in this Loue; and that with his ſecond heart, which God created pure and cleane in him and his right Spirit, which he renewed in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels by holy Penance, he ſung the Canticle of Loue farre more melodiouſly, then euer he had done, with his firſt heart and Spirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All true Louers are equall in this, that all giue all their heart to God, and with all their force, but vnequall, in the diuerſitie of giuing it, whence one giues all his heart with all his force yet leſſe perfectly then the others. Some giues it
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:2765:322"/> it all by Martyrdome, all by virginitie, all by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, all by action, all by contemplation, all by a paſtorall function; and though all giue it all, by the obſeruance of the Commandements; yet doth ſome one giue it with leſſe perfection then the others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo IACOB hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelfe, who was called the HOLY-of-GOD in DANIEL, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God proteſteth that he loued, confeſſeth ingeniouſly that he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue LABAN with all his ſtrength: and why did he ſerue LABAN, but to obtaine RACHEL, whom he loued with all his forces? He ſerues LABAN with all his forces; he ſerues GOD with all his forces: he Loues RACHEL with all his forces, he Loues GOD with all his forces: yet Loues he not RACHEL as GOD, nor GOD as RACHEL: He Loues GOD as his God aboue all things and more then himſelfe; he Loues RACHEL in qualitie of a wife, and as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: he Loues God with an abſolute and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely ſupreame Loue; and RACHEL with the cheefeſt nuptiall Loue.

For 1. there was one that was his ſingularly deare and wholy perfect one, moſt rare, as a ſingular doue, with which the others entred not into compariſon, and for this reaſon she was called by his owne name SVNAMITE. 2. There were ſixtie, which next to her, had the firſt ranke of honour and eſtimation, and were called Queenes. Beſids which, there were thirdly Foureſcore Dames, which were not indeede Queenes, yet were companions of his Royall bed, in qualitie of honorable and lawfull friends. 4. and laſtly, there were young damſells without number, reſerued in expectation, as a ſeedeplat, to ſucceede in the places of the former, when they should fall into decaye. Now, by the

For what is it to forſake the ſwine, but to reclame ones ſelfe from ſinne? and what is it to returne all ragged, tattered, and ſtinking, but to haue our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections engaged in the habits and inclinations which tend to ſinne? yet was he poſſeſſed of the life of the ſoule which is Loue. And as a Phenix ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of her ashes he finds himſelfe newly riſen to life. He was dead, quoth his Father, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to life, he is reuiued.

               <p n="3">3. But there are certaine ſoules who hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie made ſome progreſſe in the Loue of God, haue alſo cut off the affections they had to dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous things, and yet doe entertaine dangerous and ſuperſluous Loues: becauſe they Loue with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and Loue that which God ordaines they should Loue, with a Loue too nice and paſſionate. It ſtood with Gods pleaſure that ADAM should loue EVE tenderly, yet not in that degree of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, that to content her, he should haue vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the order giuen him by his Diuine Maieſtie. He loued not then a ſuperfluous thing, nor a thing in it ſelfe dangerous, but he loued it ſuperfluouſly and dangerouſly. The loue of our Parents, friends and Benefactours, is in it ſelfe according to GOD, yet we may affect it with exceſſe; as we may alſo our vocations, be they neuer ſo ſpirituall; and our exerciſes of deuotion (which yet we ought ſo greately to affect) may beloued inordinatly, to wit, if we preferre them before obedience, or a more generall good; or in caſe we loue them in qualitie of LAST END, being the onely meanes and furtherances to our finall pretention, which is DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE LOVE. And thoſe ſoules which Loue nothing, but that which God would haue them to Loue, and yet doe exceede in the manner of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, doe truly Loue the Diuine Goodneſſe aboue all things, yet not in all things: for the things, which not onely by permiſsion but euen by command they are to Loue according to God, they doe not onely Loue according to God, but for other cauſes and motiues, which though
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:2765:324"/> indeede they be not contrarie to God, yet are they out of him; ſo that they reſemble the Phenix, who hauning gotten her firſt feathers, and beginning to waxe ſtrong, doth forthwith hoiſt her ſelfe vp into the open aire, yet is not long able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew flight, but is forced to light often vpon the ground, to take breath. Such was the poore young man, who hauing from his tender age obſerued Gods Commandements, deſired not his neighbours goods, yet affected his owne too tenderly. So that when our Sauiour gaue him Counſell to giue them to the poore, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſad and melancholie. He loued nothing but that which he might lawfully loue, but he loued it with a ſuperfluous and too obliging an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is plaine therefore, THEO: that theſe ſoules loue too ardently and with ſuperfluitie, yet loue they not the ſuperfluities, but onely the thing which is to be loued. And herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doe enioye the marriage bed of the heauenly Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is vnions, recollections, and the repoſes of loue, whereof we ſpoke in the 5. and 6. booke: Marry they doe not enioye them in qualitie of Spouſes, becauſe the ſuperfluitie with which they affect good things, hinders them from a frequent entrie into theſe Diuine Vnions with the Spouſe, being buſied and diſtracted in louing that out of him and without him, which they ought not to Loue but in him and for him.</p>

               <head>Of two other degrees of greater perfection, by which we may Loue God aboue all things. <hi>CHAPTER. V.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. NOw there are other ſoules that neither Loue ſuperfluities, nor yet with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie, but loue onely that which God will, and as he will; Bleſſed ſoules, who loue God, their friends in God, and their enemyes for God, they Loue many things together with God, but none at all, ſaue in God and for God: It is God that they Loue, not onely aboue all things, but euen in all things and all things in God, reſembling the Phenix growne young againe, and come to her perfect ſtrength, which is neuer ſeene but in the aire, or vpon the tops of mountaines that touch vpon the aire; for ſo theſe ſoules Loue nothing but in God; though indeede they Loue many things with God, and God with many things. S. LVKE recounts that our Sauiour inuited a young man to follow him, who indeede loued him deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but he had alſo a great affection to his Father, and therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a mind to returne home to him. But our Sauiour out of this ſuperfluitie of Loue, and excited him to a Loue more pure, that he might not onely Loue our Sauiour more then his Father, but that he should not euen Loue him at all, but in our Sauiour. Leaue the care of burying
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:2765:325"/> the dead to the dead, as for thee, (who haſt met with life) goe and preach the Kingdome of Heauen. And theſe ſoules, as you ſee THEOT: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo great a connection with the Spouſe, they merite to participate of his ranke, and to be Queenes, as he is King; being they are entirely dedicated to him without diuiſion or ſeperation at all, hauing no affections out of him, or without him, but onely in him, and for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But aboue all theſe ſoules, there is yet one Onely-one, who is the Queene of Queenes, the moſt louing, the moſt Louelie, and the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of all the Friends of the Diuine Spouſe, who doth not onely Loue God aboue all things, and in all things, but euen Loues nothing but God in all things; ſo that she Loues not many things, but one onely thing, which is God himſelfe: And whereas it is God alone that she loueth in all that she loueth, she Loues him indifferently in all things, according as his good pleaſure may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, out of all, and without all. If it be onely HESTER that Aſſuerus loueth, why should he more Loue her being perfumed and deckt, then in her ordinarie attire? If it be my Sauiour onely that I Loue, why should I not as much affect the Mount Caluarie, as the Mount Thabor, ſince he is as well in the one as in the other? and why should I not as cordially pronounce in the one as in the other, IT IS GOOD FOR VS TO BE HERE. If I Loue my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in Egipt, without louing Egipt: why shall I not Loue him in Simon the Leporous his banket without louing the Banket, and if I Loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the blaſphemies which are poured vpon him
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:2765:326"/> not louing the blaſphemies, why shall I not Loue him perfumed with Magdalens pretious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without either affecting the oyntment or the ſent thereof? It is a true ſigne that we Loue onely God in all things, when we Loue him equally in all things, ſince that he being in himſelfe immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, the mutabilitie of our Loue towards him, muſt needes proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome thing that is not himſelfe. Now, the ſacred Louer, Loues her God no more with the whole world to boote, then though he were all alone without the world: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is out of God, and is not God, is as nothing to her. An entirely pure ſoule Loues not euen Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by reaſon that her Spouſe is loued therein: but a Spouſe ſo ſoueraignly beloued in his Heauen, that if yet he had no Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beſtow, he would neither appeare leſſe amiable, nor be leſſe beloued of this generous louing heart, who cannot Loue the Heauen of her Spouſe, but onely her Spouſe of Heauen, and who puts no leſſe price vpon Caluarie while her Spouſe is there crucified, then vpon Heauen where he is glorified. He that waighes one of the little bullets of S. Clare of Monte-falco, finds it as heauie, as all the three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So doth perfect Loue find God as amiable all alone, as together with all the creaturs for as much as the creaturs are onely loued in God, and for God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Soules in this degree of perfection are ſo thinne ſowen, that each of them are called their Mothers onely one, which is the Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and each of them is called the onely doue, becauſe she onely loues her mate; she is termed
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:2765:326"/> perfect, for that by loue she is made the ſame thing with the Soueraigne Perfection whence she may ſaie in a moſt humble truth; I am not, but for my beloued, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he is wholy turned towards me. Now there is none ſaue the moſt Bleſſed Virgin our Ladie, that is perfectly arriued at this hight of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, in the loue of her dearely beloued: For she is a DOVE ſo ſingularly ſingular in Loue, that all the reſt being compared to her, are rather to be termed Dawes then Doues. But let vs leaue this Peereleſſe Queene in her matchleſſe eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. There haue yet bene other ſoules, that haue found themſelues ſo happie in the ſtate of this pure loue, that in compariſon of their companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they might take the ranke of QVEENES of onely DOVES, of perfect FRIENDS of the SPOVSE. For I praie you THEO: in what degree muſt he needes haue bene, who from his very heart ſung to God,
<q>
                     <l>To what in Heauen but thee can I aſpire?</l>
                     <l>Or what in earth but thee, can I deſire?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And he that cried out. I doe eſteeme all things as dung that I may gaine IESVS CHRIST: did he not teſtifie that he loued nothing out of his Maiſter, and that out of all things he drew arguments of his Maiſters Loue? And what could be the feeling of that great Louer, who ſighed all the night, my God is my all. Such was S. AVGVSTINE, S. BERNARD, the two S. Catharins of Sienna and Genua, and diuers others, by whoſe imitation euery one may aſpire to this diuine degree of Loue. O rare and ſingular ſoules, which reſemble not at all the birds of this world, no, not the Phenix her ſelfe, though ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:2765:327"/> rare; but are onely repreſented by the bird, who for her excellent beautie, and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is ſaied not to be of this world, but of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, whereof she beares the name: for this daintie bird diſdaining the earth, doth neuer touch it, but liues aboue in the aire; yea euen when she is forced to vnwearie her ſelfe, she will onely cleeue by the ſmale twigs of trees vpon which she hangs in the aire, out of which, or without which, she can neither flie nor repoſe. And euen ſo theſe great ſoules, doe not in very deede Loue the Creaturs in themſelues, but in their Creatour, and their Creatour in them. But if they cleeue to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the law of Charitie, it is onely to repoſe in God, the onely and finall aime of their Loue. So that finding God in the Creaturs, and the Creaturs in God, they Loue God indeede not the Creaturs; as they that fishing for Pearles find them in their shelles, doe eſteeme their fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for pearles onely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the reſt, I doe not thinke, that there was euer any mortall Creature, that loued the heauenly Spouſe with this matchleſſe Loue ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure, except the Virgin who was his Spouſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Mother both together; but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the practiſe of theſe foure differences of Loue, on can hardly be any long time without paſſing from one of them to another. The Soules which as young wenches, are as yet intangled in diuers vaine and dangerous affections, are not ſometimes without hauing the moſt pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent touches of Loue: but being but glimpſe and paſsing lightnings, one cannot therevpon
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:2765:327"/> rightly ſaie, that ſuch ſoules are got out of the ſtate of young girles which are Nouices and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes. It happens alſo ſometimes, that the ſoules that are in the degree of onely and perfect Louers, doe much relent and waxe cold, yea euen to the committing, and falling into troubleſome veniall ſinns: as may be gathered by many bitter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtirred vp amongſt Gods great ſeruants; yea euen amongſt ſome of the Diuine Apoſtles, who as we cannot denie fell into ſome imperfections, by which notwithſtanding Charitie was not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, yet the feruour thereof was troubled. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit whereas ordinarily thoſe great ſoules loued God with a Loue perfectly pure, we are not to denie that they were in the ſtate of perfect Loue. For how oft doe we ſee, that good trees though they neuer bring forth any venemous fruit, yet doe they produce raw and vnripe ones, corrupted with miſſeltoe or moſſe: So the great Saints neuer fell into mortall ſinne, yet fell they eaſily into fruitleſſe actions and ſuch as are greene, bitter, harsh, and ill taſted. And as euen in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we muſt confeſſe that thoſe trees are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, otherwiſe they could not be called good, ſo are we in no ſort to denie, that ſome of their fruit was fruitleſſe. For who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denie that the miſſeltoe and moſſe of trees, is an vnprofitable fruit? and who can alſo denie that ſmale angers, and minute exceſſes of ioye, of laughter, of vanitie, and of other the like paſſions, are vnprofitable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull motions? and yet the Iuſt man brings them forth ſeauen times a day, that is, very often.</p>

               <head>That the Loue of God aboue all things is common to all Louers. <hi>CHAPTER VI.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. Though there be ſo ſundrie degrees of Loue amongſt true Louers, yet is there but one Commandement of Loue onely, which doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and equally oblige euery one with a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like and entirely equall obligation, though it be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly obſerued, and with an infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perfections, there being peraduenture, was few ſoules found in earth as Angels in Heauen, perfectly equall in Loue: ſeeing that as one ſtarre differs from another in brightneſſe, ſo shall the Bleſſed in their Reſurrection, where euery one ſings a Canticle of Glorie, and receiues a name, knowen to none but to him that receiues it. But what degree of Loue is it, to which the Diuine Commandement doth equally, vniuerſally and continually oblige all?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a peece of the holy Ghoſts proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that in our ordinarie verſion which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie hath canonized and ſanctified by the Councell of Trent, the heauenly Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Loue, is expreſſed in the word DILECTION rather then by the word LOVE; for albeit that DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTION be a kind of Loue, yet is it not a ſimple Loue, but a Loue of choice and election, which ſenſe the word it ſelfe carries, as the glorious S. THOMAS doth note: for this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:2765:328"/> vs a Loue choſen out of thouſands, like to him to whom it is due, who as the beloued Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite markes him out in the Canticles, is one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of thouſands. It is Loue that is to haue power ouer all our affections, and is to raigne ouer all our paſsions: and that which God exacteth of vs is, that of all our Loues, his may be the moſt cordiall, bearing rule ouer our heart; the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, poſſeſſing our whole ſoule; the moſt generall, applying all our powers; the higheſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenishing our whole heart; and the moſt ſolide, exerciſing all our ſtrength and prowiſe. And whereas by this we doe chooſe and elect God, for the Soueraigne obiect of our ſoule, it is a Loue of Soueraigne Election, or an election of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Loue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You are not ignorant, THEO: that there are diuers ſpecies of Loue: as for example, there is a fatherly Loue, a brotherly Loue, a filiall Loue and a nuptiall Loue; a Loue of ſocietie, of obligation, of dependance, and an hundred more, which are all different in excellencie, and ſo proportioned to their obiects, that ſcarcely can they be applied, or appropriated to any other. He that should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Father, with the Loue of a brother onely, should come short of his dutie. He that should Loue his wife in qualitie of a Father onely, he should not loue her ſufficiently. He that should loue his Lackey as his owne child, would be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med impertinent. Loue is as honour: for as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is diuerſified according to the diuerſitie of excellencies to which it is attributed; ſo Loues are diuers, according to the diuerſitie of the GOOD
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:2765:329"/> which is loued. Soueraigne honour is due to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Excellencie; and Soueraigne loue to the Soueraigne Good. The loue of God is a loue without compariſon, becauſe the goodneſſe of God is incomparable. Harke Iſrael, Thy God is the ſole Lord, and therefore thou shalt loue him with thy whole ſoule, thy whole vnderſtanding, thy whole ſtrength: For God is the onely Lord, and his goodneſſe is infinitly aboue all goodneſſe: and he is to be loued with a loue which is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, excellent and puiſſant beyond all compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It is this ſupreame loue, that placeth God in ſuch eſteeme amidſt our ſoules, and makes vs repute it ſo great a happineſſe to be gracious in his ſight; that we preferre him before, and loue him aboue all things. Now THEOT: doe you not plainly ſee, that he that loues God in this ſort, hath dedicated his whole ſoule and ſtrength to God, ſith for euer and in all occurrences, he will preferre Gods honour before all things; keeping himſelfe in a readineſſe to forſake the whole world, to preſerue the loue which is due to the Diuine Goodneſſe. And in ſomme, it is the loue of Excellencie, or the Excellencie of loue, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to all mortalls in generall, and each one of them in particular from their firſt vſe of reaſon. A loue ſufficient for euery one, and neceſſarie for all that will be ſaued.</p>

               <p n="1">1. VVE doe not alwayes clearely know, nay not at all certainely, at leaſt by a certaintie of Faith, whether we haue the true loue of God, requiſite to our ſaluation, yet haue we diuers markes thereof, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt which the moſt aſſured, and in a manner infallible is ſeene in the oppoſition, which the loue of creaturs makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our deſignes of God's loue: For in that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, if Diuine Loue raigne in the ſoule it makes appeare the force of the credit and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which it hath ouer the will, shewing by effects not onely that he hath no Maiſter, but that he hath euen no equall, repreſſing and proſtrating all oppoſition, and making his intentions be obeyed. When the accurſed companie of hellish ſpirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting from their Creatour, eſſayed to draw to their faction the troupes of the Bleſſed Spirits; the glorious S. MICHAEL encouraging his fellow-ſoldiers to the loyaltie which they ought to their God, cried (Marry after an Angelicall manner) with a loude voice through out the ſtreets of the Heauenly Hieruſalem. WHO IS LIKE TO GOD? And in this word he ouerthrew that Traitor Lucifer with his route, who equalized themſelues to the Diuine maieſtie, and thence, as
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:2765:330"/> it is ſaied, S. MICHAELS name was impoſed, ſince that MICHAEL imports no other thing then WHO IS LIKE TO GOD? And when the loue of created things, would draw our hearts to their PARTIE, to make vs diſobedient to the Diuine Maieſtie, if the great diuine loue be found in the ſoule, it makes head againſt it, as an other MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAEL, and makes good the powers and forces of the ſoule to Gods ſeruice; by this word of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, WHO IS LIKE TO GOD? What beautie doth there appeare in creaturs, which ought to draw man's heart to a rebellion againſt the ſoueraigne bountie of God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As ſoone as that holy and braue gentleman Ioſeph, perceiued that the loue of his Miſtreſſe tended to the ruine of that which was due to his Maiſter: ah quoth he, be it farre from me, that I should violate the reſpect which I owe to my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who repoſeth ſo much truſt in me? how can I then admit this crime, and ſinne againſt my God? marke THEO: marke how there are three loues in the louelie Ioſephs heart: for he loues his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, his Maiſter, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d God; but as ſoone as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes loue riſeth vp agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt his Maiſters, he ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſakes it, and away he runnes; as he would alſo haue forſaken his Maiſters, if he had found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to God's. Amongſt all the loues God's is ſo to be preferred that is, one muſt alwayes ſtand prepared in mind to forſake them all for that alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. SARA gaue her maide AGAR to her husband ABRAHAM, to th'end that he might haue children by her, following the lawfull cuſtome of thoſe
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:2765:330"/> times: But Agar hauing conceiued, did greatly contemne her Miſtreſſe SARA: till then, ſcarcely could one diſcerne whether ABRAHAM bore more affection to SARA or AGAR; for AGAR was as well his bedfellowe as SARA, yea with fertilitie to boote; but when the God Abraham came to make compariſon betweene his loues, he made manifeſt which was the ſtronger: for no ſooner had Sara made her complaint that she was contemned by Agar, but he told her, thy chamber maide Agar is in thy power, doe vpon her what thou think'ſt good. So that from thence forth Sara did ſo afflict the poore Agar that she was conſtrained to retire her ſelfe. Diuine Loue doth willingly permit that we should haue other loues; nor can we ſometimes eaſily diſcouer which loue is the cheife in our heart: for this man's heart of ours, doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moſt eagerly draw the loue of creaturs into the bed of his Complacene, yea it happens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he makes more frequent acts of his loue towards creaturs, then towards his Creatour: while yet Diuine loue in him leaues not to excell all the other loues, as the euents make cleare, vpon the Creaturs oppoſitions to their Creatour; for then he takes ſacred loues part, ſubmitting vnto it all his affections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is great difference betwixt the bulke and value of things created. One of Cleopatras pearles was more worth then one of our higheſt rockes, marry this is greater, the one hath bulke, the other worth. It is made a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether the honour which a Prince atchiues in warrs by feats of armes, or that which he merits by iuſtice in
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:2765:331"/> time of peace be greater; and me thinks, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie glorie is bigger, the other better: euen as of inſtruments, drumes and Trumpets make more noiſe; Luts and virginalls more melodie: the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the one is ſtronger, the other ſweeter, and more ſpirituall. An ounce of Baulme giues not ſo ſtrong an odour, as a pound of Spickenard oyle, howbeit the ſmell of baulme, is alwayes better and more pleaſing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. True it is, THEO: you shall ſee a mother ſo buſie about her child, that it might ſeeme, she had no other loue but that, hauing eyes onely to ſee it, mouth to kiſſe it, breaſt to giue it ſucke, care to bring it vp and one would thinke that her husband were nothing to her, in reſpect of her child: but if she were to make choice, whether she would looſe; one would then plainely ſee, that she more eſteemes her husband, yea and that though the Loue of her child was more tender, more preſsing and paſſionate, yet that the other was more excellent, forceable and better. So when a heart Loues God in reſpect of his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though with neuer ſo little a portion of this excellent loue, it will preferre Gods will before all things, and in all the occaſions that shall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it will forſake all, to conſerue himſelfe in grace with the Soueraigne Goodneſſe, without being hindred by any thing at all. So that, though this diuine Loue, doth not alwayes ſo ſenſibly vrge and ſoften the heart, as doe the other Loues: yet in the occurrences, it performes ſo high and excellent actions, that one of them onely, is better than tenne millions of the others.

Our Loue towards creaturs, doth often abound in the multitude of productions: but when ſacred Loue doth its worke, it is ſo eminently purfect, that it ſurpaſſeth all: for it cauſeth God to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all things without reſerue.</p>

But Saphricius in no wiſe anſwering to his inuitations, did ſtill repulſe the reconcilement, with as great inhumanitie, as Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus beſought it with humilitie; In ſo much that the poore Nicephorus, apprehending that in caſe Saphricius should ſee hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proſtrate at his feete begging pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would be more touched to the heart with it; he goes and finds him out, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly caſting himſelfe groueling at his feete: Reuerend Father, quoth he, ah pardon me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee for the bowels of our Sauiour IESVS: but euen this humilitie was diſdaigned and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together with his former endeuours.</p>

Meane while, behold a hote perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe againſt the Chriſtians, in which, Saphricius with others being apprehended, did wounders in ſuffering a thouſand thouſand torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="607" facs="tcp:2765:332"/> was publikly led out of priſon, towards the place where he was to receiue the glorious crowne of Martyrdome which Nicephorus had no ſooner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, but ſodainely he ranne and hauing met his Saphricius, throwing himſelfe vpon the ground, Alas cried he with a lowde voice, ô Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of IESVS-CHRIST pardon me; for I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee: whereof Saphricius taking no notice, the poore Nicephorus getting againe before him by a shorter paſſage, ſet vpon him a new with the like humilitie, coniuring him to pardon him, in theſe termes, ô Martyr of IESVS CHRIST, pardon the offence which I haue committed againſt thee being a poore man ſubiect to offend: for loe a crowne is alreadie beſtowed vpon thee by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour whom thou deneyedſt not, yea thou haſt confeſſed his holy name in the face of many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. But Saphricius continuing in his inſolencie, gaue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not one word in anſwere; but onely the Exe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cutioner admiring the perſeuerance of Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus; neuer, quoth he to him, did we ſee ſo great an Aſſe; this fellow is going euen at this inſtant to die; what haſt thou to doe with his pardon? To whom Nicephorus anſwering, thou knoweſt not quoth he, what it is I demand of this Confeſſour of IESVS CHRIST, but God kowes. Now in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim Saphricius arriued at the place of execution, where yet againe Nicephorus hurling himſelfe vpon the grownd before him; I beſeech thee, quoth he, ô Martyr of IESVS CHRIST, that it would pleaſe thee to pardon me: for it is written aske and it shall be granted you. Words which could not at all bowe the flintie and rebellious heart of
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:2765:333"/> the accurſed Saphricius, who obſtinatly denying mercy to his neighbour, was himſelfe depriued, by the iuſt iudgment of God, of the moſt glorious Palme of Martyrdome: for the Headsman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to put himſelfe vpon his knees, that he might behead him, he begun to be daunted, and to condition with him, making, in the end, this deplorable and shamefull ſubmiſſion. Ah, for pitie doe not behead me, I will ſubmite my ſelfe to the Emperours ordonance, and ſacrifice to the Idols. Which the poore good man Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus hearing, with teares in his eyes he begun to crie: Ah my deare brother, doe not, doe not I beſeech thee, tranſgreſſe the law, and denie IESVS CHRIST: Forſake him not, for loue, looſe not the crowne of glorie which with ſo great paines and torments thou haſt atchiued. But alas this miſerable Prieſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Altar of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome there to conſacrate his life to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, had not called to mind what the Prince of martyres had ſaied: If thou carrie thy offering vnto the Altar, and remember that thy brother hath ſomewhat againſt thee, leaue thy offering there, goe and be reconciled vnto thy brother, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come, and preſent thyne offering. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God reiected his preſent, and withdrawing his mercy from him, permitted that he loſt not onely the ſoueraigne felicitie of Martyrdome, but euen fell headlong into the miſerie of Idolatrie; while the humble and meeke Nicephorus, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this crowne of Martyrdome vacant, by the Apoſtaſie of the obdurate Saphricius, touched with an excellent and extraordinarie inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, put faire

At which the officers being wonderfully aſtonished, they carried the tidings to the Emperour; who gaue order for Saphricius his libertie, and that Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus should be put to death: which happened the 9. of Feb: about the yeare 260. of our Sauiour as Metaphraſtes and Surivs recounteth. A dreadfull hiſtorie, and worthy diligently to be pondered in the behalfe we ſpeake off: for did you not note, my deare THEO: the Couragious Saphricius, how bold and feruent he was in the defence of his faith, how he ſuffered a thouſand torments, how conſtant and immoueable he was in the confeſsion of our Sauiours name, while he was roled and crusht in that preſſe like machine; how readie he was to receiue death's blow, to fulfill the higheſt point of the Diuine lawe, preferring God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before his owne life. And yet becauſe on the other ſide he preferred the ſatisfaction which his cruell heart tooke in hating Nicephorus before the Diuine will, he came short of the goale, and while he was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of attaining and gaining the priſe of glorie by Martyrdome, vnprofitably ſtrumbling and falling into Idolatrie broke his necke.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is therefore true, my THEO: that it is not enough for vs, to loue God more then our owne life, vnleſſe we alſo loue him generally, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly, and without reſerue, more then all we
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:2765:334"/> doe or can loue. But you will ſaie vnto me, did not our Sauiour deſigne the furtheſt point of our Loue towards him, in ſaying that a man could not haue a greater charitie, then to expoſe a mans life for his friends? It is true indeede, THEO: that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the particular acts, and teſtimonies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue, there is none ſo great, as to vndergoe death for Gods glorie: yet it is alſo true, that it is but onely one act, one onely teſtimonie; which indeede is the Maiſter peece of Charitie; but beſids it, Charitie exacts many things at our hands, and ſo much more ardently and inſtantly, as they are acts more eaſie, common and ordinarie amongſt all the Louers, and more generally neceſſarie to the conſeruation of Diuine Loue. O miſerable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phricius, durſt thou be bould to affirme that thou loued'ſt God as thou ought'ſt, whil'ſt thou doeſt not preferre the will of God before the paſsion of hatred and ranckour entertained in thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poore Nicephorus? To be willing to die for God is one and the greateſt, but not the onely act of Loue which we owe to God. To will this act onely, with excluding the others, is not charitie, but vanitie. Charitie is not fantaſticall, which yet she would be in the highſt degree, if being reſolued to pleaſe the Beloued in things of greateſt difficultie, she would permit one to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in matters of of leſſe mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. How should he die for God, who will not liue accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to God?</p>
               <p n="5">5. A well ordered mind that is reſolued to die for a friend, would alſo without doubt vndergoe all other things: for he that hath once deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed death, ought not to ſet by other things.
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:2765:334"/> But the mind of man is weake, inconſtant and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous: wherevpon he doth oft rather chooſe to die then to vndergoe farre ſlighter paines; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly changing life, for a friuelous, childish, and extreamely vaine contentment. Agripina hauing learn't that the child which she bore, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede be Emperour, but yet that he would put her to death. Let him kill me, quoth she, prouided that he raigne: marke, I praie you the diſorder of this foolishly louing mothers heart: she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr's her ſonn's dignitie, before her owne life. Cato and Cleopatra chooſed death rather, then to ſee their enemies exult and glorie in hauing them: And Lucrecia found it eaſier to precipitate herſelfe impetuouſly vpon death, then vniuſtly to be branded with the shame of a fact, whereof she ſeemed not guiltie. How many are there that would willingly embrace death for their friend, who yet would not liue in their ſeruice, or yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their other deſires? Such there are as will lay open their life to danger, who yet will not open their purſe. And though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny found, who engage their life for their friends defence, yet ſcarcely is there one found in an age, that will engage his libertie, or looſe an ounce of the moſt vaine and vnprofitable reputation, or renowne in the world, be it for neuer ſo deare a friend.</p>

               <p n="1">1. YOu know THEO: of what nature Iacobs loues towards Rachel were, and what did not he doe to teſtifie their greateneſſe, force and fidelitie, euen from the houre he had ſaluted her at the head of the fountaine? For fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thenceforth neuer did he ceaſe to die of loue for her; and to game her in Marriage he ſerued ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whole yeares, with an incredible deſire; conceiuing yet in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that all this was nothing, ſo did Loue ſweete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paines which he ſupported for his beloued Rachel, whereof being after fruſtrated, he ſerued yet other ſeuen yeares ſpace to obtaine her, ſo conſtant, loyall and couragious was he in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! And hauing at length obtained her, he neglected all other affections, yea and had in a manner in no eſteeme euen Lia her ſeruice, though his firſt Spouſe, a woman of great merite, worthy to be cherished; and of the neglect whereof euen God himſelfe tooke compaſſion, ſo remarkable it was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But all this being done, which was euen ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to haue brought downe the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainefull wench in the world, to the loue of ſo
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:2765:335"/> loyall a Louer, it is a shame verily to ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which Rachel made appeare in her affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Iacob. The poore neglected Lia, had no tye of Loue with Iacob ſaue her onely fertilitie, whereby she had made him, a father to foure Sonn's; the eldeſt whereof named RVBEN, being gone forth into the fields, in the time of wheat-harueſt, he found Mandragores, which he gathered, and after, his returne home preſented to his mother. Which Rachel eſpying, ſaied, giue me part of thy Sonns Mandragores: she anſwered doeſt thou thinke it a ſmall matter, that thou haſt taken my husband from me, vnleſſe thou take alſo my Sonn's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragores? Goe too, ſaied Rachel for thy Sonn's Mandragores, let him ſleepe with thee this night. She accepted the condition, and when Iacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at euen from the field, Lia went out to meete him a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſaied, with ioyfull cheere, this night thou art myne my deare Lord and friend, becauſe with wages I haue hired thee, for my Sonn's Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragores: and with this, vp and told him, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact which had paſſed betwixt her and Rachel. But from Iacob, beleeue it, there was no words heard, being ſtruck with a maiſement, and hauing his heart ſeaſed with the weakeneſſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Rachel who for a thing of nothing had forſaken, for a whole night the honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his preſence. For ſpeake the truth, THEO: was it not a ſtrange and vaine lightneſſe in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, to preferre a companie of little Aples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chaſt loues of ſo louing a husband. If it had yet bene done for Kingdomes, for Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies: but to doe it for a poore handfull of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragores!
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:2765:336"/> THEOTIME, what conceite frame you of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And yet returning home to our owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, ah good God, how oft doe we make ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions infinitly more shamefull and wretched? The great S. AVGVSTINE vpon a time tooke pleaſure leaſurely to view and contemplate Mandragores, the better to diſcerne the cauſe why Rachel had ſo paſsionatly coueted them. And he found that they were indeede pleaſing to the view, and of a delightfull ſmell, yet altogether inſipide and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guſt. Now; Plinie recounts, that when the Surgeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s orders that ſuch as they are to cut should drinke the iuyce of them, to th'end they might not feele the ſmart of the lance, it happens often that the very ſmell doth worke the operation, and doth ſufficiently put the patient into a ſleepe. wherevpon the Mandragora is held a bewitching Plant, which doth inchant the eyes, ſorrowes, and all kind of paſsions by ſleepe. For the reſt he that ſmels the ſent of them too long turnes deafe; and he that drinks too much of them, dies without redemption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEOT: could pompes, riches and terreane delights, be better repreſented? they haue a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out-ſide; but ah he that bites this aple, that is, he that ſounds their natures, finds neither taſte nor contentment in them. Neuertheleſſe they doe ſo inchant and bewitch vs with the vanities of their ſmell; and the renowne which the Sonn's of the world giue them, doth benumme and put thoſe into a deepe ſleepe which doe attentiuely linger in them; or ſuch as receiue them in too great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:2765:336"/> And alas theſe are the Mandragores, the Chimera's and fantomes of pleaſurs for which we caſt off the loue of the heauenly Spouſe. And how can we then truely ſaie that we loue him ſince we preferre ſo friuolous vanities, before his grace?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is it not a deplorable wonder to ſee a DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID, ſo noble in ſurmounting hatred, ſo generous in pardoning iniuries, and yet ſo impotently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious in mater of Loue, that not being ſatiated with the vniuſt detaining of a number of wiues, he muſt needes yet wrongfully vſurpe and take away by rape, the poore Vrias his wife. Yea and by an inſupportable treacherie, put to ſlaughter her poore husband, that he might the better enioye the Loue of his wife? Who would not admire the heart of a SAINT PETER, which was ſo brauely bold amidſt the armed ſoldiers, that he of all his Maiſters troupe was the firſt and onely man that drew and layed about him; and yet a little after ſo cowardly amongſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed women, that at the worde of a wench, he denied and deteſted his Maiſter; And how can it ſeeme ſo ſtrange to vs that Rachel could ſell the chaſt embracements of her Iacob for Aples of the Mandragore, ſince that Adame and Eue forſooke euen grace for an Aple, and that too, preſented by a Serpent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In fine, I will tell you a word worthy of note. Heretikes are Heretikes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beare the name of ſuch, becauſe of the Articles of Faith they chooſe at their guſt and pleaſure what likes them beſt, and thoſe they beleeue, reiecting and diſauowing the others. And Catholiks are Catholiks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:2765:337"/> without choice or election at all, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with an equall aſſurance, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, all the faith of the Church. Now it happens after the ſame manner in the Articles of Charitie; It is an heraſie in ſacred loue, to make choice of Gods Commandements, which to obſerue, and which to violate. He that ſaied thou shalt not kill, ſaied alſo; thou shalt not commite adulterie. It is not then for the loue of God, that thou killeſt not, but it is ſome other motiue, that makes thee rather chooſe this commandement then the other. A choice that hatcheth hereſie in matter of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. If one should tell me, that he would not cut my arme, out of a loue to me, and yet would pull out myne eyes, breake my head, or ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne me quite through; ah, should I ſaie, with what face can you tell me that it is in reſpect of my Loue, that you wound not myne arme, ſince you make no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to pull out myne eyes; which are no leſſe deare vnto me? yet ſince you ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne me quite through the bodie with your ſword, which is more perilous for me? It is an Axiome that good comes from an entire cauſe, but euill from each defect; That the act of Charitie be perfect, it muſt proceede from an entire, generall and vniuerſall Loue, which is extended to all the Diuine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if we faile in any one Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, loue ceaſeth to be entire and vniuerſall; and the heart wherein it harbers, cannot be truely called a louing heart, nor conſequently a truly good one.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AS God created man to his owne Image and likeneſſe, ſo did he ordaine a loue for
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:2765:339"/> man, to the image and reſemblance of the loue which is due to his owne Diuinitie. Thou shalt loue, ſaieth he, thy Lord, thy God with all thy heart, it is the firſt and greateſt commandement: And the ſecond is like vnto this, Thou shalt loue thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe. Why doe we loue God, THEO: The cauſe why we loue God, ſaieth S. BERNARD, is God himſelfe: as though he had ſaied, we loue God becauſe he is the moſt ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and infinite Goodneſſe. And why doe we loue our ſelues in Charitie? ſurely becauſe we are the Image and likneſſe of God. And whereas all men are indewed with the ſame dignitie, we loue him alſo as our ſelues, that is, in qualitie of the moſt holy and liuely Image of the Diuinitie: for it is in that qualitie, THEO: that we belong to God in ſo ſtrict an aliance, and ſo amiable a dependance, that he makes no difficultie to be called Father, and to call vs children. It is in this qualitie that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be vnited to his Diuine eſſence, by the fruition of his ſoueraigne bountie and felicitie. It is in this qualitie that we receiue his grace, that our ſpirits are aſſociated to his moſt holy ſpirit, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner participa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Diuine nature as S. LEO ſayeth. And therefore the ſame Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which produceth the acts of the loue of God, produceth withall the acts of the loue of our neighbour. And euen as Iacob ſaw but one ladder which reached from Heauen to earth, by which the Angels did as well deſcend as aſcend, ſo we ſee that one ſame charitie extends it ſelfe both to the loue of God and our neighbour, raiſing vs to the vnion of our ſpirit with God, and yet brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Yet with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that we loue our neighbour, in that he is created to the Image and likeneſſe of God, to haue communication with the Diuine bountie, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of grace, and fruition of glorie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEO: to loue our Neighbour in Charitie is to loue God in man, or man in God; It is to loue God for his owne ſake, and the creature for the loue of him. The young Tobie accompained with the Angell Raphael, hauing met with Raguel his Father to whom yet he was vnknowen. Raguel had no ſooner ſet his eyes vpon him, ſaieth the Scripture, but turning himſelfe towards his wife Anne; looke looke quoth he how much this you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man doth reſemble my coſen: and hauing ſaied thus, he ſaied vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whence come you youthes, my deare bretheren? at which they replied: We are of the Tribe of Nephtali, of the Captiuitie of Niniuie, and he ſaied vnto them; doe you know my brother Tobie? yes Sir, we know him, replied they: and Raguel beginning highly to commend him, the Angell ſaied vnto him; Tobie of whom you ſpeake, is this youths owne Father; with that Raguel ſtept towards him and kiſsing him with many teares, and ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vpon his necke, bleſsing haue thou my ſonne, quoth he, becauſe thou art the ſonne of a good and moſt vertuous man: and the good woman Anne his wife and Sara his daughter, began to weepe through tenderneſſe of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Doe not you note, how Raguel, embraced the little Tobie, cherished, kiſſed and wept with ioye vpon him, whom he knew not. Whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:2765:340"/> this Loue but from old Tobie his Father, whom this child did ſo much reſemble? Bleſsing haſie thou, quoth he, but why? not truly becauſe thou art a good youth, for that as yet I know not, but becauſe thou art ſonne and like to thy Father, who is a very good man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ah good God THEOT: when we ſee our neighbour created to the Image and likeneſſe of God, ought we not to ſaie one to another. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and ſee this creature, how it reſembles the Creatour, ought we not to caſt our ſelues vpon it, cherishe it, and weepe ouer it with loue? ought we not to bleſſe it a thouſand and a thouſand times? And why this? For the loue of it? no verily: for we know not whether it be worthy of loue, or hatred in it ſelfe; but wherefore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? O THEO: for the loue of God, who hath framed it to his owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe and conſequently hath endowed it with a capacitie to be partaker of his goodneſſe, in GRACE, and GLORIE. For the loue of God, I ſaie, from whom it is, whoſe it is, by whom it is, in whom it is, for whom it is, and whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles in a moſt particular manner. Wherevpon the diuine loue doth not onely often times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the loue of our neighbours, but it ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it, and poures it into man's heart, as his reſemblance and Image: for euen as man is the Image of God, ſo the ſacred loue of man towards man, is the true picture of the heauenly loue of man towards God. But this diſcourſe of the loue of our neighbour requires a whole Treatiſe a part, which I beſeech the Soueraigne Louer of men, to inſpire into ſome of his moſt excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:2765:341"/> ſince the top of the loue of the Diuine Goodneſſe of the heauenly Father, conſiſteth in the perfection of the loue of our brothers and companions in earth.</p>

               <head>How loue produceth Zeale. <hi>CHAPTER. XII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. AS Loue rends towards the Good of the thing beloued, either by taking delight in it being obtained, or in deſiring and purſuing it not being obtained. So it brings forth hatred by which it flies the euill which is contrarie to the thing beloued, either in deſiring and ſtriuing to be quit of it, being alreadie preſent, or in abſence, by eſſaying to diuert and hinder its approch. But if euill can neither be hindred to approch, nor be remoued, loue at leaſt leaues not to make it be hated and deteſted. When loue therefore is ſeruent, and is come to that hight, that it would take away, remoue, and diuert that which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the thing beloued, it is termed Zeale. So that in proper ſpeach, Zeale is no other thing then loue in its ardour, or rather the ardour that is in loue. And therefore, ſuch as the loue is, ſuch is the Zeale which is in ardour. If the loue be good the Zeale is Good, if bad, the Zeale is alſo bad. Now when I ſpeake of Zeale, I meane to ſpeake of iealouſie too: for iealouſie is a SPECIES of Zeale, and vnleſſe I be deceiued, there is but this onely
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:2765:341"/> difference betweene them; That Zeale hath a reſpect to all the Good of the thing beloued, with intention to remoue the contrarie euill from it: but iealouſie eyes the particular good of friends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipe, to th'end it might repulſe all that doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When therefore we ardently ſet our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vpon earthly and temporall things, beautie, honours, riches, Place: That Zeale, that is, the ardour of that Loue, ends ordinarily with enuie: becauſe theſe baſe and vile things, are ſo little, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, particular, finite, and imperfect, that being poſſeſſed by one, another cannot entirely poſſeſſe them. So that being communicated to diuers, each one in particular hath a leſſe perfect communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. But when we loue in particular to be ardently beloued, the Zeale, or ardour of this Loue turnes into Iealouſie; becauſe humane frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe, though otherwiſe a vertue, hath this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by reaſon of our weakneſſe, that being diuided amongſt many, euery ones part it leſſe. Wherevpon the ardour or Zeale we haue to be beloued, will not permit corriualls and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: which if we apprehend we haue, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fall into the paſsion of Iealouſie, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede doth in ſome ſort reſemble enuie, yet is farre an other thing. 1. Enuie is alwayes vniuſt, but iealouſie is ſometimes iuſt, ſo that it be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: for haue not ſuch as are married good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to looke that an others shareing with them doe not cauſe their friendship's decreaſe? Enuie makes vs ſorrowfull that our neighbour enioys a like, or a greater good then we, though he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:2765:342"/> not that which we haue one iot. But iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie is in no wiſe troubled at our neighbours good ſo it touch not vpon our coppie-hold: for the Iealous man would not be ſorrie that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion should be beloued of others, ſo it were not of his owne Miſtreſſe. Yea properly ſpeaking, a man is not iealous of Competitours, till he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that he himſelfe hath alreadie atchiued the friendshipe of the partie beloued. And if there be any paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that preceedes this, it is not iealouſie but enuie. 3. We doe not preſuppoſe any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the partie we enuie, but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie we apprehend that he hath the good which we doe enuie in him. Marry we preſuppoſe that the partie whereof we are iealous, is imperfect, fickle ſubiect to corruption and change. 4. Iealouſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from loue, enuie comes from the defect of Loue. 5. Iealouſie neuer happens but in matter of Loue, but enuie is extended to all the ſubiects of good; to honours, to fauours to beautie. And if at any time one be enuious of the affection which is borne to another, it is not for loue, but for the profit that is in it. The Enuious man is not a whit troubled to ſee his fellow in grace with his Prince, ſo that he be not in occurrences gratified and preferred by him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. GOd ſaieth thus: I am thy Lord thy God, a iealous God. Our Lord is called Iealous.
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:2765:342"/> God is iealous then, THEO: but what is his iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; verily vpon the firſt ſight, it ſeemes to be a iealouſie of Concupiſcence ſuch as is a husbands ouer his wife: for he will haue vs ſo to be his, that he will in no ſort haue vs to be any others but his. No man ſaieth he can ſerue two Maiſters. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all our heart, all our ſoule, all our ſpirit, all our ſtrength; for this very reaſon he is called our ſpouſe, our ſoules his Spouſes; And all ſorts of ſeparations from him, are called fornication, Adulterie. And indeede it is high reaſon that this great God, ſingularly good, should moſt entirely exact our whole heart: for our heart is but little, and cannot ſtore vs with loue enough, worthily to loue the Diuine Goodneſſe; is it not therefore conuenient, that ſince we cannot afford him ſuch a meaſure of Loue as were requiſite, that at leaſt we should afford him all we are able? The GOOD that is ſoueraignely louely, ought it not to be ſoueraignely loued? and to loue ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely is to loue totally.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Howbeit Gods iealouſie of vs, is not truely a iealouſie of concupiſcence but of SOVERAIGNE FRIENDSHIPE: for it is not his profit, that we should loue him, but ours. Our loue is vnprofitable to him, but to vs gainefull; and if it be agreeable to him, it is becauſe it is profitable to vs: For being the Soueraigne GOOD, he takes pleaſure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe by loue, without any kind of profit that can returne to him thereby, whence he cries out, making his complaint of ſinners by way of iealouſie. They haue forſaken me, me that am the fountaine of liuing water; and haue digged
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:2765:343"/> vnto themſelues Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns that are not able to hold water: marke a little THEO: I praie you, how this Diuine Louer doth delicatly well expreſſe the nobilitie and generoſitie of his Iealouſie: they haue left me, ſaieth he, me that am the Source of liuing water: I complaine not that they haue forſaken me, in reſpect of any damage that their reuoult can draw vpon me: for what worſe is a liuing ſpring, that men will not draw water at it? will it therefore leaue to glide and ſlide ouer the earth? but I am ſorrie for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that hauing left me, they haue buſied themſelues about wells without water. And if by ſuppoſition of an impoſsible thing, they could haue light vpon ſome other fountaine of liuing water, I should eaſily endure their departure from me, ſince I pretend nothing in their loue, but their owne good: but to forſake me to perish; to flie from me to fall headlong, is that which doth aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and offend me in their follie: It is then for the loue of vs, that he deſires that we should loue him, becauſe we cannot ceaſe to loue him, but we begin to be loſt, nor withdraw any part of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from him, but we looſe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Put me, ſaied the Diuine shepheard to the Sunamite, put me as a ſeale vpon thy heart, as a ſeale vpon thy arme; The Sunamits heart was full of the heauenly Loue of her deare Spouſe, who though he poſſeſſe all, yet is he not content in that, but by a holy diſtruſt of iealouſie he will be ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart which he poſſeſſeth, and will haue her ſealed vp with himſelfe, leaſt any of the loue due to him might eſcape out, or any thing get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:2765:343"/> which might cauſe a mixture: for he is not ſatisfied with the loue, in which the Sunamite is compleat vnleſſe she be alſo vnchangeable, purely and onely his. And that he may not onely enioye the affections of our heart, but alſo the effects and operations of our hands, he will alſo be as a ſeale vpon our right arme, that it may not be ſtreched out, or imployed, ſaue in the works of his ſeruice. And the reaſon of the Diuine Spouſe his demande is that as death is ſo ſtrong, that it ſeparats the ſoule from all things, yea euen from her owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; ſo ſacred loue which is come to the degree of Zeale, doth diuide and put the ſoule at a diſtance withall affections, and doth purifie her from all mixture: for as much as it is not onely as ſtrong as death, but it is withall sharpe, reſolute, ſtife, and pitileſſe in punishing the wrong done vnto it, in the admittance of Competitors together with it, as Hell is violent in punishing the damned: And euen as Hell full of horrour, rage, and crueltie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no mixture of loue, ſo doth iealous loue tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate no mixture of another affection, ſtriuing that the whole should be reſerued for the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Nothing is ſo ſweete as the Doue, yet nothing ſo mercileſſe as he in his iealouſie towards his hen. If euer you tooke notice, THEO: you haue ſeene that this milde birde, returning from his flight, and finding his mate amongſt her companions, he is not able to ſuppreſſe in himſelfe a certaine ſenſe of diſtruſt, which makes him churlish and humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo that at their firſt accoſting, he circles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, with a ſoure and out faceing countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> trampling vpon her, and beating her with his
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:2765:344"/> wings though he haue otherwiſe aſſurance that she is loyall and ſees her ſnowie white in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Vpon a certaine day S. CaTHARINE of Sienna was in a Rapture, which did not bereeue her of her ſenſes, and while God was shewing her wonders, a brother of hers paſſed by, and with the noiſe he made diuerted her, ſo that she turned towards him, and eyed him one onely moment. This little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, which did on the ſodaine ſurpriſe her, was neither ſinne, nor diſloyaltie, but an onely shadow of ſinne, and an onely reſemblance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie: and yet the moſt holy mother of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Spouſe, did ſo earneſtly chide her for it, and the glorious S. PAVLE did ſo confound her in it, that she thought she should haue melted away in teares. And Dauid reeſtablished in grace by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue, how was he treated for the onely veniall ſinne which he had committed in taking a Liſt of his People?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But THEO: he that deſires to ſee this Iealouſie put downe in a delicate and excellent expreſsion, let him read the Inſtructions which the Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call S. CATHARINE of Genua made in declaration of the proprieties of pure Loue, amongſt which she doth inſtantly inculcate and preſſe this which enſueth: That perfect Loue, that is, Loue which is come to the perfection of Zeale, cannot endure any mediation, interpoſition, or the mixture of any other thing not euen of God's gifts, yea it is in this hight of rigour, that it permit's not euen the loue of Heauen, but with intention to loue more perfectly therein the Goodneſſe of him that giues it: So that the Lampes of this pure Loue haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:2765:344"/> oyle, weeke, nor ſmoake, but are all fire and flame, which no worldly thing can extinguish. And ſuch as carrie theſe burning Lampes in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, haue the ſaintly feare of holy Spouſes, not the feare of adulterous women. Both feare indeede, but differently, ſaieth S. AVGVSTINE, The chaſt Spouſe feares the abſence of her Spouſe; The adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of hers. That feares his departure, this his ſtaie: That is ſo deeply in Loue, that it makes her iealous, this is not annoy'd with iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, becauſe she enioyes not Loue; This feares to be punished, but the punishment which that feares, is, that she shall not beloued enough; yea rather in very deede, she feares not, not to belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as is the cuſtome of the Iealous, who loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and will needes be beloued; but her feare is that she loues not him enough whom she ſees ſo loue-worthy, that none can loue him to the worth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the large meaſure of loue which he merit's, as before I haue faied. Wherefore her Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, is not a IEALOVSIE OF PROPER INTEREST, but a pure Iealouſie, which proceedes not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any concupiſcence, but from a noble and ſimple frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipe: A Iealouſie which extends it ſelfe to our neighbour, together with the loue whence it iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth: for ſince we loue our neighbour as our ſelues, for Gods ſake; we are alſo iealous of him, as of our ſelues, for God's ſake, ſo that we would euen die leaſt he might perish.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now as Zeale is an inflamed ardour, or an ardent inflamation of Loue, it hath alſo neede to be wiſely and prudently practiſed; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vnder the cloake of it, one may violate the
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:2765:345"/> termes of modeſtie and diſcretion, and eaſily ſlipe out of Zeale into anger, and from a iuſt affection, to an vniuſt paſsion; wherefore this not being the proper place to put downe the markes of Zeale, my THEO: I aduiſe you that for the execution thereof you haue alwayes recourre to him whom God hath giuen you, for the direction of your deuote life.</p>

And God doth no leſſe poure his loue into one ſoule, albeit with it he loue an infinitie of others, then though he loued her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the force of his Loue, not decreaſing by the multitude of rayes which it ſtreames out, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining full of his immenſitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But wherein then conſiſteth the Iealouſie and Zeale which we ought to haue towards the Diuine Goodneſſe? THEO: their office is: firſt to hate, flie, hinder, deteſt, reiect, to ſet vpon, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,

My Zeale hath made me ſownd, becauſe my enemies haue forgotten thy words. In the morning I killed all the ſinners that were vpon the face of the earth, that I might ruinate, and banish all the workers of iniquitie. See I praie you THEO: with what a Zeale this great king is animated, and how he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes the paſsions of his ſoule in the ſeruice of holy Iealouſie! He doth not ſimply hate iniquitie, but hath it in abomination, vpon the ſight of it he withers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. Secondly Zeale makes vs ardently iealous of the puritie of ſoules, which are the Spouſes of IESVS CHRIST, according to the holy Apoſtle to the Corinthians, I emulate you with the emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, for I haue deſpouſed you to one man to preſent you a chaſt Virgin to IESVS Chriſt. Eliezer had bene extreamly ſtung with Iealouſie, if he had perceiued the chaſt and faire Rebecca,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:2765:346"/> whom he conueyed to be eſpouſed to his Maiſters ſonne, in any danger of being dishonored; and doubtleſſe he might haue ſaied to this holy Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell I am Iealous of you, with a iealouſie which I owe to my Maiſter's reſpect: for I haue deſpouſed you to one man, to preſent you a chaſt virgin to my Maiſter Abraham's Sonne. So would the great S. PAVLE ſaie to his Corinthians: I was ſent from God to you: ſoules, to treate the marriage of an eternall vnion, betweene his ſonne our Sauiour, and you, and I haue deſpouſed you vnto him, to preſent you as a chaſt virgine to this heauenly Spouſe. Behold why I am emulous, not with myne owne emulation but with the emulation of God, in whoſe behalfe I haue treated with you. It was this Iealouſie THEO: that cauſed this holy Apoſtle dayly to fall downe in trances and die: I die dayly, quoth he, for thy glorie. Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is ſcandalized and I am not burnt? Marke, ſaie the Auncients, marke what loue, what care and what iealouſie a broode Hen doth shew to her chickens, (for our Sauiour eſteemed not this compariſon vnworthy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Alwayes her head is vp, alwayes her eyes watchfull, ſtill throwing them on euery ſide, at the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of danger towards her young ones: No enemie appears, vpon whom she dares not throw her ſelfe in the defence of her deare broode, for whom she hath a continuall ſollicitude, which makes her ſtill ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vp and downe clocking a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining.
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:2765:347"/> And if any of her chickings come to die, what griefe? what anger? Such is the iealouſie of Parents for their children, of Paſtours for their flockes, of brothers for their Brothers. What was the Zeale of the Children of Iacob, after they had knowe that DINA was violated? what was the Zeale of Iob, vpon the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion and feare he had that his children should offend God? what was the Zeale of a S. Paule for his brethren according to flesh and blood, and his children according to God, for whoſe ſake he deſired to be branded with ANATHEMA and excommunication? what the Zeale of a Moyſes towards his people, for whom he is willing, in a certaine manner to be raſed out of the booke of life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In humane iealouſie we are afrayed leaſt the thing beloued, should be poſſeſſed by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but our Zeale to God, makes vs eſpecially feare, that we are not wholy poſſeſſed by him. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane iealouſie makes vs apprehend that we are not beloued enough; Chriſtian iealouſie, that we loue not enough, wherevpon the ſacred Sunamite cried out, ô the beloued of my ſoule, show me where thou lyeſt in the midday, leaſt I beginne to wander after the flocks of my companions. Her feare is that she is not entirely her ſacred shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheards, or that she might be hindred, though neuer ſo little, by ſuch as ſtriue to be his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors.

VVHereas Zeale is an ardour and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of loue, it ſtands in neede of prudent conduct, otherwiſe it will violate the termes of modeſtie and diſcretion: not that diuine Loue, though neuer ſo vehement, can be exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue in it ſelfe, nor in the motions and inclinations, which it giues to our hearts, but becauſe it makes vſe of the vnderſtanding in the execution of its deſignes, ordering that it should find out the meanes whereby they might haue good ſucceſſe, and that it should haue boldneſſe or anger in a readineſſe, to encounter and ſurmount difficulties, it happens very frequently, that the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding propoſeth, and makes vs vndertake too sharpe and violent courſes; and withall, that anger or boldneſſe being once ſet on foote, and not being able to containe themſelues within the bounds of reaſon, beare a way the heart to diſorder; ſo that Zeale by this meanes being exerciſed indiſcretly and inordinatly, becomes hurtfull and blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. DAVID ſent IACOB to leade his armie, againſt his diſloyall and rebellious So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ABSALO<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall charge that they should not touch him, but in all occurrences they should haue a ſpeciall care to ſaue his life: But IACOB being ſet to't and being hot in the purſuite of the victorie, with his owne
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:2765:348"/> hand ſlewe the poore Abſolon, neuer thinking of the charge which the king gaue him: euen ſo Zeale doth imploye choler againſt the euill, yet with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe order, that in diſtroying wickedneſſe and ſinne, if it be poſsible, it ſaue the ſinner and the wicked; but being once in hot blood, as a ſtrong headed and ſtirring horſe, runnes away with his rider out of the Liſtes, without ſtop or ſtaie while breath laſteth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The good man of the houſe, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour deſcribs in the Ghoſpell, knew well that hot and violent ſeruants are wont to out runne their Maiſters intention: For his ſeruants preſenting themſelues vnto him, to weede vp darnell, no quoth he, I will not leaſt together with weedes you pull vp corne. Verily, THEO: Anger is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, who being ſtrong, couragious, and a great vndertaker, doth indeede at the firſt on-ſet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a great deale of worke, but with all is ſo hot headdie, inconſiderate, and impetuous, that it doth neuer any good at all, but ordinarily it drawes with it many diſcomodities. Now it is not good husbandrie, ſaie our husbandmen to keepe Peacokes about the houſe; for though they free it of ſpiders, yet doe they ſo ſpoile their couers and tiles that their profit is not comparable to the great waſte they make. Anger was giuen as a helpe to reaſon by Nature, and is employed by Grace in the ſeruice of Zeale, to put in execution it's deſignes; yet is it a dangerous helpe, and not greately to be deſired: for if it get ſtrength it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms Miſtreſſe, defeating Reaſon's authoritie, and the louing lawes of Zeale: and if it turne weake,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:2765:348"/> it doth no more then Zeale would performe all alone; how ſoeuer, it giues ſtill a iuſt occaſion of feare, that waxing ſtrong; it might impare the heart and Zeale, making them ſlaues to its tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, euen as an artificiall fire which in an inſtant is kindled in a building, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Selfe Loue doth oft deceiue vs, and makes vs runne-counter, practiſing our proper paſſions vnder the name of Zeale, Zeale hath ſometimes of old made vſe of Anger: and Anger often times makes vſe of the name of Zeale in counterchange to keepe its shamefull diſorder couered vnder it. And marke, that I ſaie, it makes vſe of the name of Zeale; for it can make no vſe of Zeale it ſelfe, ſince it is the propertie of all vertues, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Charitie whereof Zeale is a depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance, to be ſo good, that none can abuſe it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Vpon a day there came a notorious ſinner, and threw himſelfe at the feete of a good and worthy prieſt, proteſting with a great deale of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he came to find a cure for his deſeaſe, that is, to receiue the holy abſolution of his faults: a certaine MONKE called DEMOPHILVS, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his conceite, that this poore penitent came too nigh the high Altar, fell into ſo violent a fit of choler, that falling vpon him, he kicked and pushed him thence with his feete, wronging the good prieſt in an outragious ſort, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his dutie, had mildly admitted the poore penitent: And then running vnto the Altar, he
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:2765:349"/> tooke away the moſt holy things there, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them thence, leaſt, as he would make men thinke, the place should haue bene profaned by the ſinners approch: Now hauing finished this ſpecious maiſter-peece of Zeale, he ſtaied not yet there, but made a great matter of it to the great S. DENIS AREOPAGITE, in a letter which he wrote touching it, whereof he receiued an excellent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, worthy of the Apoſtolicall ſpirit, wherwith this great Diſciple of S. PAVLE was animated: for he made him clearely ſee that his Zeale had bene indiſcreete, imprude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and impudent withall: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though the Zeale of the honour due vnto holy things be good and laudable, yet was it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed againſt reaſon, without conſideration, or iudgement at all, ſince he had vſed pushing with his feete, outrage, iniurie, and reproch, in a place, in a circumſtance, and againſt a perſon that he was to honour, loue, and reſpect, ſo that the Zeale could not be good, being ſo diſorderly practiſed. But in this very anſwere, the ſame Saint recounts another admirable example of a great Zeale proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a very good ſoule, whom yet the exceſſe of Anger, which Zeale did excite in her, had blemished and ſpoyled.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Pagan had ſeduced and made a Chriſtian of CANDIE newly conuerred to the Faith returne to Idolatrie: CARPVS an eminent man for puritie and ſanctitie of life, and who as it is very probable, was the Bishope of Candie, conceiued ſo deepe a wroth againſt it, that he had neuer in his time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the like, and let himſelfe be ſo farre carried away with this paſsion, that being riſen at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:2765:349"/> to praie according to his cuſtome, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in him ſelfe that it was not reaſonable, that wicked men should any longer liue, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation beſeeching the Diuine Iuſtice, to ſtrike downe at once theſe two ſinners, the Pagan ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour, and Chriſtian ſeduced. But note, THEO: how God corrected the bitterneſſe of the paſsion, which carried the poore CARPVS beyond himſelfe. Firſt he made him as another S. STEPHEN behold the heauens open, and our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST ſeated vpon a great throne enuironed with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Angels, who aſsiſted him, in humane shape; then he ſaw below, the earth gaping open, as a horrid and vaſt gulfe, and the two ſinners to whom he had wished ſo much euill vpon the very edge of this Precipice, quaking, and well nere fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe in a traunce for dread being vpon the point of tumbling in, drawen on the one ſide by a multitude of Serpents, which riſing out of the gulfe, wrapped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues about their ledges, tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with their tayles, and prouoking their fall: and the other ſide a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of men did push and iogge, to rush them in; ſo that they ſeemed to be eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alreadie ſwallowed vp by this precipice: Now conſider, my THEO: I praie you, the violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of CARPVS his paſsion: for as he himſelfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recounted to S.

THEO: the holy man CARPVS had iuſt reaſon to be zealouſly moued at theſe two men, and his Zeale had but rightly ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſtomacke againſt them, but being once moued, he left reaſon and Zeale behind him, ouer ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning the bounds and limits of holy loue, and conſequently Zeale which is loue in its heate; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger changed the hatred of ſinne into the hatred of the ſinner, and the moſt mild Charitie into an outragious crueltie.</p>

<pb n="647" facs="tcp:2765:352"/> the Monke ordained for the Quire, courſe about; if you will giue credit to his diſquieted ſpirit; that cauſeth all thoſe cenſures and murmuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the Prelates of the Church, and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall Princes, if you will giue eare to the arrogant. You shall heare nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him but Zeale; nor yet ſee any Zeale in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but onely opprobrious and rayling ſpeaches hatred a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>core, diſquiete of the heart and to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Zeale may be practiſed three wayes: firſt in exerciſing high actions of Iuſtice to repell euill; and this belongs onely to publike officers, to correct, cenſure, and reprehend in the nature of a Superiour, as Princes, Prelates, Magiſtrats, Preachers: but whereas this office is worshipfull, euery one will vndertake it, euery one will haue a fingar in it. Secondly, one may vſe Zeale in actions of great vertue, for the good example of others, by ſuggeſting the remedies of euill, and exhorting men to applie them, by working the good that is oppoſite to the euill which we deſire to banish, which is a thing that belongs to euery one, and yet it hath but few vndertakers. Finally the moſt excellent vſe of Zeale is placed in ſuffering and enduring much to hinder or diuert euill, and ſcarce will any admit this Zeale. A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Zeale is all our ambition: vpon that, each one willingly ſpends his talant, neuer taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that it is not Zeale indeede which is there ſought for, but glorie, ambition's ſatisfaction, choler, churlishneſſe and other paſsions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Certainly our Sauiours Zeale did princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally appeare in his death vpon the Croſſe, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy death and ſinne in men: wherein he was ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:2765:353"/> imitated by that admirable veſſell of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and dilection, as the great S. GREGORIE Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen in golden words repreſents him: for ſpeaking of this holy Apoſtle, he fights for all, ſaieth he, he poures out praiers for all, he is Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly paſſionat towards all, he is inflamed for all, yea he dared yet more for his brethren accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to flesh, ſo that if I may dare alſo to ſaie it, he deſires through charitie, that they might haue euen his owne place, nere our Sauiour. O excellencie of an incredible courage and feruour of Spirit? He imitats IESVS CHRIST, who became a curſe for our Loue, who put on our infirmities, and bore our deſeaſes. Or that I may ſpeake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſoberly, he was the firſt after our Sauiour that refuſed not to ſuffer and to be reputed wicked in their behalfe. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo then, THEO: as our Sauiour was whip't, condemned, crucified as man, deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bequeathed, and dedicated to beare and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all the reproches, ignominies and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due to all the offenders in the world, and to be a generall ſacrifice for ſinne being made as an ANATHEMA, forſaken and left of his eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo according to the true doctrine of this great Nazianzen, the glorious Apoſtle S. PAVLE deſired to be loden with ignominie, to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, left abandoned and ſacrificed for the ſinnes of the Iewes, that the curſe and paine which they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited might fall vpon him. And as our Sauiour did ſo take vpon him the ſinnes of the world and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a curſe, was ſacrificed for ſinne, and forſaken of his Father, that he ceaſed not continually to be the well-beloued Sonne in which his Father plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:2765:353"/> himſelfe: So the holy Apoſtle deſired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to be a curſe, and to be ſeparated from his Maiſter, to be left alone to the mercy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and punishments due vnto the Iewes; yet did he neuer deſire to be depriued of Charitie and the grace of God, from which nothing could ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate him, that is, he deſired to be vſed as one ſeparated, from God, but he deſired not in effect to be ſeparated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or depriued of his Grace; for this cannot be piouſly deſired. So the heauenly Spouſe confeſſeth that though loue be ſtrong as death, which makes a ſeparation betwixt the bodie and the ſoule. Yet Zeale which is an ardent loue, is yet ſtronger; for it reſembles Hell, which ſeparats the ſoule from our Sauiours ſight; but it was neuer ſaied, nor can euer be ſaied, that Loue or Zeale was Like to ſinne, which alone ſeparats from the grace of God. And indeede how could the ardour of Loue poſsibly make one deſire to be ſeparated from grace, ſince Loue is grace it ſelfe, or at leaſt cannot conſiſt without grace? Now the Zeale of the great S. PAVLE was in ſome ſort practiſed by the little S. PAVLE, I meane S. PAVLINE, who to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer a ſlaue out of bondage became himſelfe a ſlaue, ſacrificing his owne libertie, to beſtow it vpon his neighbour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Happie is he, ſaieth S. AMBROSE, who knowes the gouernment of Zeale! The Deuil will eaſily ſcofe at thy Zeale, if it be not according to ſcience, let therefore thy Zeale be inflamed with Charitie, adorned with ſcience, eſtablished in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie. True Zeale is the child of Charitie, as being the ardour of it: Wherefore, like to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:2765:354"/> it is patient, benigne, not troubleſome nor contentious, not enuious or ſpightfull, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in Truth. The ardour of true Zeale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of the huntsman, being dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, actiue, induſtrious and eager in the purſuit, but without choler, anger, or trouble: for if the huntsman's labour were cholerike, harsh and wayward, it would not be ſo earneſtly loued and affected. Zeale in like manner hath extreame fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, but ſuch as are conſtant, ſolide, ſweete, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, equally amiable and infatigable; whereas contrariwiſe, falſe Zeale is turbulent, confuſed, inſolent, arrogant, cholericke, wauering, no leſſe impetuous then inconſtant.</p>

HAuing ſpoken at large of the acts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue, that you may more eaſily and holily conſerue the memorie thereof, I preſent you with a collection or abridgement of it. The Charitie of IESVS CHRIST doth preſſe vs, ſaieth the great Apoſtle: Yea truly, THEO: it doth force, or vſe a violence againſt vs by its infinite ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which shines in the whole worke of our Redemption, wherein appeared the benignitie and loue of our Sauiour towards men. For what did not this Diuine Louer doe in matter of Loue?
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:2765:354"/> 1. he loued vs with a LOVE OF COMPLACENCE, for his delightes were to be with the children of men, and to draw man to himſelfe beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming man. 2. he loued vs with a LOVE of BENEVOLENCE enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching man with his diuinitie, ſo that man was God. 3. he vnited himſelfe vnto vs in an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby he adhered, and ioyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo neerely indiſſolubly, and infinitly to our nature, that neuer was any thing ſo ſtraightly ioyned and preſſed to the humanitie, as is now the moſt ſacred Diuinitie, in the perſon of the Sonno of God. 4. he ranne wholy into vs, and as it were, diſſolued his greatneſſe to bring it downe to the forme and figure of our littleneſſe, whence he is inſtyled a Source of liuing water, dewe and rayne of Heauen.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He was in extaſie, not onely in that, as S. DENIS ſaieth, by the exceſſe of his louing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he became in a certaine manner out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, extending his prouidence to all things, and beeing in all things; but alſo, in that, as S.

And he, of whom it is ſo frequent written, I LIVE SAIED OVR LORD, pleaſed afterwards according to his Apoſtles language to ſaie, I liue, now not I, but man liues in me, man is my life, and to die
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:2765:355"/> for man, is my gaines, my life is hidden with man in God. He that did inhabit in himſelfe, lodgeth now in vs: and he that was liuing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all eternitie in the boſome of his eternall Father, becomes mortall in the boſome of his temporall mother. He that liued eternally by his owne Diuine life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued temporally a humane life: And he that from eternitie had bene onely God, shall be for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie man too: ſo did the loue of man rauish God, and draw him into an Extaſie!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sixtly how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by loue did he admire, as he did the Centurion, and the Cananee? 7. he beheld the young man who had till that houre keept the Commandements and deſired to be taught perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 8. he tooke a louing repoſe in vs, yea euen with ſome ſuſpenſion of his ſenſes, in his mothers wombe and in his infancie. 9. he was wonderfull tender towards little children, which he would take in his armes, and louingly dandle a ſleepe; towards MARTHA and MAGDALEN, towards La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus ouer whom he wept, as alſo ouer the Citie of Hieruſalem. 10. he was animated with an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Zeale, which, as S.

He was alſo ſad, and ſweate blood of diſtreſſe in the garden of Oliuet; not onely by reaſon of the exceeding griefe which his ſoule felt in the inferiour part of reaſon; but alſo through the ſingular loue which he bore vnto vs in the ſuperiour portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, ſorrow begetting in him a horrour of death, yet loue, an extreame deſire of the ſame; ſo that there was a hote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and a cruell agonie, betwixt deſire and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of death, vnto the shedding of much blood, which ſtreamed downe vpon the earth as from a liuing ſource.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Finally THEO: this Diuine Louer died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the flames and ardours of Loue; by reaſon of the infinite charitie which he had towards vs; and by the force and vertue of Loue, that is, he died in Loue, by Loue, for Loue, and of Loue: for though his cruell torments were ſufficient to haue kild any bodie; yet could death neuer make a breach in his life, who keepes the keyes of life and death, vnleſſe Diuine Loue, which hath the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thoſe keyes, had opened the Port to death to let it ſacke that Diuine bodie, and diſpoyle it of life. Loue not being content to haue made him mortall onely, vnleſſe it had made him die withall. It was by choice, not by force of torment that he died. No man doth take my life from me, ſaieth he, but I yeeld it of my ſelfe and I haue power to yeeld it, and I haue power to take it againe. He was offered, ſaieth Iſaie, becauſe he himſelfe
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:2765:356"/> would and therefore it is not ſaied that his Spirit went away, forſooke him, or ſeparated it ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him; but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe that he gaue vp his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, expired, rendred vp the Ghoſt, yeelded his Spirit vp into the hands of the eternall Father; ſo that S. ATHANASIVS remarketh, that he ſtooped downe with head to die, to the end he might conſent, and bend towards deaths approch, which otherwiſe durſt not haue come neere him: and crying out with a lowde voice, he gaue vp his Spirit into his Fathers hands, to shew, that as he had ſtrength and breath enough not to die, ſo had he ſo much Loue, that he could no longer liue, but would by his death reuiue thoſe, which without it could neuer eſchew death, nor pretend for true life. Wherefore our Sauiours death was a true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and a ſacrifice of Holocauſt, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe offered to our Sauiour to be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: for though the paines and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of his Paſsion were ſo great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that any but he had died of them, yet had he neuer died of them, vnleſſe he himſelfe had pleaſed, and vnleſſe the fire of his infinite Charitie had conſumed his life. He was then the Prieſt himſelfe, who offered vp himſelfe vnto his Father, and ſacrificed himſelfe in Loue, to Loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Loue, for Loue, from Loue.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yet beware of ſaying, THEOTIME, that this death of Loue in our Sauiour, paſſed by way of rauishment: for the obiect which his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie had to moue him to die, was not ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, that it could force this heauenly ſoule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:2765:356"/> which therefore departed the bodie by way of extaſie, driuen on and forced forwards by the abundance and force of Loue, euen as the Myrrhetree is ſeene to ſend foorth her firſt iuyce by her onely abundance, without being ſtrayned or preſſed, according to that which he himſelfe ſaied, as we haue noted. No man taketh my life away from me, but I yeelded it of my ſelfe. O God THEO: what burning coles are caſt vpon our hearts to inflame vs to the exerciſe of holy loue towards our beſt Sauiour, ſeeing he hath ſo louingly practiſed them towards vs who are his worſt ſeruants!

NABVCODONOZOR king of Babilon, had waged a iuſt warre againſt the towne of Tyrie, which the Diuine Iuſtice would chaſtice, and God ſignified to Ezechiel, that in recompence thereof he would deliuer vp Egipt into the hands of NABVCODONOZO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

HIEROME in his commentaries, we learne that in caſe the Pagans themſelues doe any Good, they are not vnrewarded by God's Iudgement. So did DANIEL exhort NABVCODONOZOR an Infidell, to redeeme his ſinnes by almes, that is, to ranſome himſelfe out of the temporall paines due vnto his ſinne, which hung ouer his head. Doe you ſee then THEO: how true it is, that God doth eſteeme vertues though practiſed by perſons otherwiſe wicked? If he had not approued the mercye of thoſe Midwiues, and the iuſtice of the Babilonian warrs, would he haue taken the paines, I praie you, to haue rewarded them? And if Daniel had not knowen, that notwithſtanding Nabucodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zors infidelitie, his almes-deedes were agreeable vnto God, why would he haue counſelled him them? Certes the Apoſtle aſſures vs that Pagans who haue no faith, doe naturally performe that
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:2765:358"/> which belongs vnto the law, and in doing ſo, who can doubt but they doe well, or that God doth make accompt of it. Pagans vnderſtoode that marriage was good and neceſſarie, they ſaw that it was conuenient to haue their children brought vp in ſciences, in loue of their countries, in ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and they did ſo. Now I leaue it to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether this was not gratefull vnto God, ſince to this end, he indewed them with the light of reaſon, and a naturall propention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Naturall reaſon is a good tree, which Gods owne finger planted in our ſoule, the fruits that ſpring from it, cannot otherwiſe be then good; yet in truth in compariſon of that which ſprings from grace they are of a very lowe rate, though not of no value, ſith God put a rate vpon them, beſtowing in reſpect of them temporall rewards, as he rewarded the morall vertues of the Romans, according to S.

Sinne without queſtion, makes the ſoule ſicke, whence she is not able to performe great and powerfull operations, though little ones she can: for all the ſicke mans actions are not ſicke; he ſpeakes, he ſees, he heares, he drinkes. The ſoule in ſinne, can doe good workes, which being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, are rewarded with naturall rewards; being ciuile, they are payed with ciuile and humane money, that is, with temporall commodities. The ſinner is not in the ſtate of the diuills, whoſe wills are ſo drunke vp, and incorporated in euill that they can will no good at all. No THEO: the ſinner

He is thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede wounded to death in the way betwixt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and Ierico, but as yet is not dead: for, ſaieth the Ghoſpell, he is left halfe aliue, and as ſuch he can produce actions halfe a liue: tis true he can neither walke, nor riſe, nor crie for aide, no not ſo much as ſpeake, ſaue onely languidly, by reaſon of his faint heart; yet can he open his eyes, ſtirre his fingers, ſigh, make ſome little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which are weake actions, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all which he might haue bene found miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lying dead in his owne blood, had not the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Samaritaine poured his owne honie and wine into his wounds and carried him to a lodging, where he gaue charge that he should be dreſſed and looked too, at his coſt.</p>

Such are the morall vertues, THEO: which though they be in a heart that is low, earthly, and greatly laboured with ſinne, yet are they not infected with the malice thereof,
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:2765:360"/> being of ſo free and innocent a nature, that they cannot be corrupted by the Societie of iniquitie, as euen ARISTOTLE himſelfe ſaied, that vertue was a habit which none could abuſe. And though the vertues, which are ſo good in themſelues, be not rewarded with an eternall Laurell when they are practiſed by infidells, or by ſuch as are not in the ſtate of grace, it is nothing ſtrange, ſince that the ſinfull heart from whence they proceede, is not capable of an eternall good, and was otherwiſe auerted from God; and ſince that none is to haue part in that celeſtiall inheritance which belongs to the ſonns of God, but ſuch as are in him, and his adoptiue brothers; beſides that the Couenant by which God promiſſeth heauen, hath referrence to ſuch onely as are in his grace, and that the vertues of ſinners haue no worth nor value, ſaue that of their owne nature, which by conſequence cannot raiſe them to the merite of ſupernaturall rewards, ſo called, for that Nature withall her appurtina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, can neither giue, nor merite them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Howbeit, the vertues which are found in the friends of God, though they be onely morall and naturall in themſelues, are yet dignified and raiſed to the worth of holy workes, by reaſon of the hearts excellencie which produceth them. It is one of the properties of friendshipe, to make the friend, and all that is good and honeſt in him, gratefull. Friendshipe doth poure out its grace and fauour vpon all the actions of the beloued, that are any wayes capable of them. A friends tartneſſe is ſweete, and the ſweetes of an enemye are bitter. All the vertuous actions of a heart that loues God,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:2765:360"/> are dedicated to God: for the heart that hath giuen himſelfe, how hath not he giuen all that depends of himſelfe? He that giues the tree without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, giues he not alſo the leeues, flowres, and fruite? The iuſt man shall flourish like the palme tree, and shall be multiplied as the Ceder of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus, they are planted in the houſe of our Lord, and shall flourish in the courtes of the houſe of our God, ſithence the iuſt man is planted in the houſe of God, his leeues, his flowres and his fruite doe there encreaſe, and are dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Maieſtie. He is as a tree planted nigh to the ſtreames of waters, which shall giue his fruite in his time: his very leaues shall not fall, and all things whatſoeuer he doth shall proſper: not onely the fruits of Charitie, and the flowres of the works which she ordaines, but euen the very leaues of morall vertues doe draw a meruellous felicitie from the loue of the heart which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them. If you graffe in a Roſe tree, and put a graine of muske in the clift of the ſtoke, all the roſes that ſpring from it, will ſmell of muske. Cleeue your heart then by holy penance, and put the loue of God in the clift, afterwards ingraffe in it what vertue you pleaſe, and the workes which ſpring from it, shall be all perfumed with Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without taking any further care thereof.</p>

Though the Spartans had heard an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſentence from the mouth of ſome wicked man they neuer iudged it fit to receiue it, till it were firſt pronounced againe by ſome good man, And therefore to make it worthy of acceptance, they onely made it be vttered againe by a vertuous

If you deſire to make the humane and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues of an EPECTETES, a SOCRATES, a DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MADES become holy, cauſe them onely to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a truely Chriſtian mouth; that is by one that is in charitie. So God did firſt reſpect ABEL, and then his offerings; ſo that his offerings had their worth and dignitie in the ſight of God, from the goodneſſe and pietie of him, that offered them. O the ſoueraigne Goodneſſe of this great God? who doth ſo loue his Louers, who doth cherish their weakeſt endeauours, and doth excellently enrich them, be they neuer ſo weake; Honouring them with the Title and qualitie of HOLY! Ah, it is in conſideration of his beloued Sonne, whoſe adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue children, he will honour, ſanctifiing all that is good in them, their bones, their haires, their garments, their graues, yea the shadowe of their bodies: Faith, Hope, Charitie, Loue, Religion, yea euen ſobrietie, courtiſie, affabilitie of heart.</p>

But when the ſame vertues are found in a truly chriſtian heart, that is, in a heart endowed with holy loue, then they doe not onely belong to God, and are not vnfruitfull in him, but become fruitfull and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious before the eyes of his goodneſſe. Giue a man Charitie, ſaieth S. AVGVSTINE, and all things are profitable vnto him; depriue him of Charitie and all the reſt profits him not.

               <p n="1">1. BVt there are ſome vertues, which by reaſon of their naturall alliance and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with Charitie, are alſo much more capable to receiue the precious influence of ſacred Loue, and conſequently, the communication of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie and worth of the ſame. Such are Faith and Hope, which together with Charitie, haue an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reference to God; and Religion together with penance and Deuotion, which are imployed to the honour of his Diuine Maieſtie. For theſe
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:2765:362"/> vertues haue naturally ſo great a reference to God, and are ſo capable of the impreſsions of heauenly loue, that to make them participate in its Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they neede onely to be by it; that is, neare a heart which loues God. So to make grapes taſt like Oliues, it is but planting the vine amongſt the Oliue-trees, for by their onely neighbourhoode, without euer touching one another, theſe plantes doe mutually enterchange fauours and properties; ſo great an inclination, and ſo ſtrict a conueniencie is there betwixt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Certes, all flowres, except thoſe of the tree called the Penſiue Tree and others that are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres in nature, all I ſaie, are gladded, diſplayed, and embellished at the Sunnes approch, by the vitall heat which they receiue from his rayes. But all yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low flowres, and eſpeciall that, which the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians terme HELIOTROPIVM, and we, TVRNE-SOLE are not onely gladded a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pleaſed with his preſence but euen follow his beames allurement, by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable winding about, to looke and turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards it, euen from the ryſing to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So all vertues doe receiue a new luſtre, and an excellent dignitie, by the preſence of holy Loue: but Faith, Hope, the Feare of God, Pietie, Penance, and all the other vertues, which of their owne natures doe particularly tend vnto God, and to his honour doe not onely receiue the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diuine loue, whereby they are eleuated to a great value, but they hang wholy towards him, aſſociate themſelues with him, following and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him in all occaſions: for in fine, my deare THEO: the holy word doth attribute a certaine
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:2765:362"/> ſauing, ſanctifying force and proprietie, to Faith Hope, Pietie, Feare of God, to Penance, which is an euidence, that thoſe vertues are of great price, and being practiſed by a heart in Charitie, they become more fruitfull, and holy by excellencie, then the others, which of their owne nature haue not ſo great an agreement with heauenly Loue. And he that cries, if I had all Faith euen in ſuch a meaſure that I could tranſport mountaines, and should want charitie, I am nothing, doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently shew, that with Charitie, this faith would be very fruitfull. Charitie then is a vertue without compare, which doth not onely adorne the heart, wherin she is, but with her meere preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth alſo bleſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſanctifie all the vertues which she meetes therein, embalming and perfuming them with her celeſtiall odour, by meanes whereof they are ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a high rate in the ſight of God; which yet she performes farre more excellently in Faith, Hope, and other vertues which of them ſelues doe naturally tend to pietie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore, THRO: of all vertuous actions we ought moſt carefully to practiſe thoſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Reuerence towards diuine things, thoſe of Faith, of Hope, and the moſt holy Feare of God; taking occaſion often to ſpeake of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, thinking, and ſighing after eternitie, frequenting the Church and Diuine ſeruice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pious lectures, obſeruing the ceremonies of chriſtian Religion: for ſacred Loue is fed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its hearts deſire in theſe exerciſes, and doth in greater abundance ſtreame out its graces and proprieties vpon them, then it doth vpon

               <p n="1">1. THe faire RACHEL after an earneſt deſire of iſſue, with her deare IACOB, was by two meanes made fertill, whence alſo she had children of two ſundrie kinds: for in the beginning of her marriage, ſeeing she could haue no children of her owne bodie, she made vſe of her ſeruant BALA, as it were by loue, which she drew into her ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the exerciſe of the functions of marriage, ſaying vnto her husband, I haue here my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide BALA, take her in wedlocke, and companie with her, that she may beare vpon my knees, and I may haue children of her, and it fell out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her deſire: For she conceiued and brought forth many children vpon RACHELS knees, who receiued them as though they had bene truely her owne, ſince they were begotten by two bodies whereof IACOBS belonged to her by the right of marriage, BALA'S by the dutie of ſeruice, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:2765:363"/> becauſe the generation was effected by her order and will. But she had afterwards two other children without her command or order, which were conceiued, begot, and ſprung from her owne bodie, at her owne bent to wit, Ioſeph, and the beloued Beniamin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I muſt tell you now, THEOT: that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and holy loue, a thouſand times more faire then Rachel, married to mans heart, doth inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly wish to produce holy operations. And if in the begining she her ſelfe cannot bring forth of her owne extraction, by the ſacred vnion which is ſingularly proper vnto her, she cals the other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as her faithfull handmaids, makes them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with her in marriage, commanding the heart to make vſe of them, and beget holy operations of them, yet operations which she doth adopt and repute her owne, as being produced by her order and commandment, and of a heart which belongs vnto her, ſith, as we haue formerly declared, Loue is the Maiſter of the heart, and conſequently, of all the acts of other vertues, made by his conſent. But further heauenly Charitie, hath two acts which are her owne iſſue properly, and are of her owne extraction, the one is EFFECTIVE LOVE, who as another IOSEPH vſing the fulneſſe of regall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, doth ſubiect, and range the troopes of our faculties, powers, paſsions and affections, to Gods will, that it might be loued, obeyed and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aboue all things, by this meanes putting the great celeſtiall commandment in execution. Thou shalt loue thy LORD thy GOD with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy Spirit, with all thy
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:2765:364"/> ſtrength: The other is AFFECTIVE OR AFFECTIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATE LOVE, who as a little Beniamin, is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly delicate, tender, pleaſing, and amiable; but in this, more happie then Beniamin, that Charitie his mother dies not in his birth, but, as it were gaines a new life, by the delight she takes in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus then THEOT: the vertuous actions of the children of God, doe all belong to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; ſome of them becauſe they ſprung from her owne wombe; others, becauſe she ſanctifies them by her quickning preſence; and finally others, by the authoritie and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de which she exerciſeth ouer the other vertues, whence she made them ſpring. And theſe, as indeede they are not ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in dignitie, as the actions which doe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediatly iſſue from Charitie, ſo doe they incomparably paſſe thoſe, which take their whole ſanctitie from the preſence, and Societie of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A great Generall of an Armie hauing gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome renowned bataile, will without doubt haue all the glorie of the victorie, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon; for he himſelfe will haue fought in the forefront of the armie eſſaying many braue feates of armes, he will haue rancked his troopes, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and commanded all that was done, ſo that he is eſteemed to haue done all; either for that he himſelfe fought in his owne perſon; or by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and command of others. And albeit ſome friendly Succours cume at vnawares, and fall in with them, yet is not the Generall depriued of the whole honour, for though thy receiued not his
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:2765:364"/> commands, yet did they obſerue them, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his intentions. But yet, after one haue attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all the honour in groſſe vnto him, a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof is made to euery part of the armie in particular, in relati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g what the VANT GARD, the BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE, and the REARE-GARD had done, as the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, the Italians, the Germans, the Spaniards behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, yea, we praiſe this a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that honoured himſelfe in the battaile. So my deare THEOT. amongſt all the vertues, the glorie of our Saluation, and victorie ouer Hell, is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Diuine Loue, who, as Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the whole armie of vertues, contriues all the plotes, by which we gaine the triumphe: For Sacred Loue hath his proper actions, which iſſue and proceede from himſelfe, by which he workes wonders of armes vpon our enemie; and with all, he rangeth, commands, and orders the actions of other vertues, which thence are termed, ACTS COMMANDED OR ORDAINED BY LOVE. And in caſe, ſome vertues produce their operations without his order, ſo they obſerue his intention, which is God's honour, he will ſtill aduowe them to be his owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet notwithſtanding, though we ſaie in groſſe with the holy Apoſtle, that Charitie ſuffers all, beleeues all, hopes for all, ſupports all, and finally that she doth all, yet doe we diſtribute in particular the praiſes of the ſaluation of the Bleſſed to other vertues, according as they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in each one: for we ſaie, ſome were ſaued by Faith, others by Almes-deedes, by Temperance, by Praier, Humilitie, Hope, Chaſtitie: others for that the acts of theſe vertues, did more notably
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:2765:365"/> shine in them. Yet ſtill after we haue extolled theſe particular vertues, we muſt aſcribe all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſacred Loue, whece they deriue all their ſanctitie. For what other thing would the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Apoſtle ſaie, inculcating that Charitie is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, patient, that she beleeues all, hopes for all, ſupports all, but that Charitie ordaines and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Patience to be patient, Hope to hope, Faith to beleeue. True it is, THEOT: that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this, he intimats alſo, that Loue is the ſoule and life of all the vertues; as though he would haue ſaied Patience is not patient enough, nor Faith faithfull; that Hope was not hopefull enough, nor mildneſſe ſufficiently milde, vnleſſe Loue doe animate and quicken them. The ſame thinge, this ſame Veſſell of Election giues vs to vnderſtand when he ſaieth, that without Charitie nothing doth profit him; and that he is nothing: for it is as though he had ſaied, that without Loue a man is neither patient, milde, conſtant, faithfull nor confident, in ſuch ſort as is required to be Gods ſeruant, which is the true and wishfull beeing of man.</p>

This was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, THEO: yet more admirable to ſee in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Charitie, wherevpon all vertues are graffed in ſuch ſort, that as one might haue ſaied of this tree, that it was a Cherri-tree, an Aple-tree, a Nut-tree, a pom-granad-tree; ſo may one ſaie of Charitie, that she is patient, milde, generous, iuſt: or rather, that she is Patience, mildneſſe, and Iuſtice it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the poore Tree of Tyuoly was not of long continuance, as the ſame PLINIE doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for theſe diuers productions did preſently drie vp its HVMIDVM RADICALE, that it withered away, and dyed; whereas contrariwiſe Charitie is fortified and made ſtronge, to produce abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of fruit in the exerciſe of all the vertues, yea as our holy Fathers haue obſerued, she is inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable in her deſires of bringing forth fruit, and neuer ceaſeth to preſſe the heart wherein she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits, as Rachel did her husband, ſaying giue me children or elſe I die.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now the fruits of graffed-trees, doe alwayes follow the graffe: For if the graffe be of an aple-tree, it will haue aples, if of a cherri-tree, it brings forth cherries, yet ſo as the fruit doth alwayes taſte of the ſtocke. In like manner, THEOT: our acts take their name and SPECIES from the particular vertues whence they ſprung, but they draw the taſte of their Sanctitie from holy Charitie, which is the roote and ſource of all Sanctitie in man, and
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:2765:366"/> as the ſtocke doth communicate it's taſte to all the fruit which ſpring from the graffe, yet ſo as that euery fruit reſerues the naturall propertie of the graffe whence it ſprung: euen ſo Charitie, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out in ſuch ſort her excellencie and dignitie vpon the acts of other vertues that she doth not depriue them of the particular worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they haue by their owne naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

All fllowres looſe their luſter and grace amidſt the nights obſcuritie; but the Sunne in the morning making them againe viſible and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, doth not yet make their beautie and grace equall; and though its light be equally ſpred ouer them all, yet doth it make them bright and glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with inequalitie, as it finds them more or leſſe capable of its brightneſſe. And let the Sunne shine neuer ſo equally vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Violet and the Roſe, yet shall it neuer make that ſo faire as this, or make a Marigold as gracious as a Lilie.

So, my THEO: if one with an equall Charitie should ſuffer the death of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and another the hungar of a faſt, who doth not ſee that this faſt shall not be ſo much prized as this Martyrdome? No, THEO: for who dare be bould to affirme, that Martyrdome is not more excellent in it ſelfe then faſting? Which being more excellent in it ſelfe, and Charitie not depriuing it of its naturall excellencie, but perfecting it, doth conſequently leaue it in the aduantages which it

Now if the loue of reaſon doe poſſeſſe and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:2765:371"/> the mynd, it will be obedient to reaſon in all occurrences, and conſequently will practiſe all the vertues. If IACOB loued RACHEL, in reſpect that she was Laban's daughter, why did he deſpiſe LIA, who was not onely the daughter, but euen the eldeſt daughter of the ſaied LABAN? But becauſe he affected RACHEL, by reaſon of her beautie, he could neuer equally loue the poore LIA, though a fruitfull and wiſe maide, not being ſo faire in his eye. He that loues a vertue for the loue of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and decorum that shines in it, he will loue them all, ſince he will find the ſame motiue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all: and he will loue each of them more or leſſe, as reaſon shall appeare in them more or leſſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. He that loues Liberalitie, and not Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, shewes ſufficiently that he loues not libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie for the beautie of reaſon, for that is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant cleare in Chaſtitie, and where the cauſe is more ſtrong, the effects ought alſo to be the like. It is therefore an euident ſigne, that that heart is not carried to liberalitie by the motiue, and in conſideration of reaſon: whence it followes that that Liberalitie which ſeemed to be a vertue, is but an apparance, ſince it proceedes not from reaſon, which is the true motiue of vertues, but from ſome other ſtranger-motiue. It is ſufficient for a child to be borne in marriage, to beare the name, (in the eye of the world) Armes, and titles of his mothers husband: but to haue his blood and nature, he muſt not onely be borne in marriage, but of the marriage: Actions haue the name, Armes, and recognoiſcence of vertue, becauſe being borne of a heart endowed with reaſon, we
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:2765:371"/> apprehend them to be reaſonable; yet haue they neither the ſubſtance nor vigour of vertue, when they proceede from a ſtrang and adulterate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, not from reaſon. It may happen then, that a man may haue ſome vertues, and not all: but they shall either be vertues newly ſpringing and as yet tender, as flowres in bloſſome, or elſe perishing and dying vertues, as faiding flowres: for in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion vertues cannot haue their true grouth and integritie, vnleſſe they be all together, as all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, and Diuinitie aſſures vs: What Prudence I praie you THEO: can an intemperate, vniuſt, and couſening knaue haue, ſince he makes choiſe of vice and forſakes vertue? And how can one be iuſt, without being Prudent, conſtant and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: Iuſtice being no other thing, but a perpetuall, ſtrong and conſtant will, to render to euery one his owne, and the ſcience by which right is done, is called IVRISPRVDENTIA; and that to giue each one his owne, we muſt leade a wiſe and modeſt life, and remoue the diſorders of intemperance in vs, thereby to render to our ſelues what belongs vnto vs? and the word VERTVE, doth it not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a force and vigour properly belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, euen as we attribute ſuch or ſuch a vertue or proprietie to hearbes, or precious ſtones?</p>

Force without Prudence, Iuſtice, and Temperance, is not force, but a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and Iuſtice is vniuſt in a gilefull man, who will not vſe it; in the intemperate man who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelfe to be carried away with paſsion, and in the imprudent man who is not able to diſcerne

It is true, THEOT: that one cannot exerciſe all the vertues at once; becauſe the occaſions are not all preſented at once, yea there are vertu, which ſome of God's greateſt Saints had neuer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to practiſe. For S. PAVLE the firſt Heremit, for example, what occaſion could he haue to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the pardoning of iniuries, Affabilitie, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, and mildneſſe? Howbeit ſuch ſoules, ſtand ſo affected to the rightneſſe of reaſon, that though they haue not all the vertues in effect, yet haue they them all, in affection, being readie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to follow and obeye reaſon in all occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without exception or reſerue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are certaine inclinations which are eſteemed vertues, and are not ſo, but fauours and aduantages of nature. How many are there, who naturally are ſober, ſimple, milde, ſtill, yea euen chaſt, and honeſt? Now all theſe ſeeme to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and yet haue no more the merite thereof, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad inclinations are worthy of blame, till we haue giuen free and voluntarie conſent to ſuch naturall humours.

<pb n="687" facs="tcp:2765:372"/> reaſon. Many there are, who apprehend that they haue the vertue, while they cxerciſe not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vice: One that was neuer aſſaulted, may truely vaunt that he neuer was a runne-away, yet hath he no ground to boaſt his vallour. He that was neuer afflicted may well praiſe himſelfe for not being impatient, yet can he not bragge of his Patience: So many thinke they haue vertues who haue onely good inclinations: and whereas thoſe inclinations are one without another, they thinke that vertues may be ſo too.</p>

MARIE EGIPTIACA, the good Thiefe, and a thouſand the like penitents who had bene great offenders, did the office and worke of all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming patient, ſweete, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liberall in them. We ſowe great varietie of ſeeds in Gardens and couer them with earth, as burying them; till the Sunne preuailing makes them riſe againe, and as one would ſaie, doth reſuſcitate them, in the production of their leaues, and fruit, which haue new ſeede, euery one in his kind; ſo that one onely heauenly heate, doth cauſe all the diuerſitie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, by meanes of the ſeede which it finds hid in the boſome of the erath. Verily, my THEO: God hath ſowen in our hearts the ſeeds of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are yet ſo couered with our imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and weakneſſe, that they did not at all, or at leaſt ſcarce appeare, till the vitall heate of holy Loue, came to quicken and reſuſcitate them, by them producing the actions of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. So that as Manna contained in it ſelfe the ſundrie taſtes of all meates, and left a relish thereof in the Iſraelits mouthes; euen in like manner hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Loue comprehends in it ſelfe the diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of all the vertues in ſo excellent, and high a ſort, that it produceth all the actions, in time and place, according to their occurrences. IOSVE did valliantly defeate God's enemyes, by his good command ouer the armies which were put in his hands. But Samſon defeated them yet more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, who by his owne hand ſlew thouſands with the iawe bone of an aſſe. IOSVE by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and good order, making vſe of the valour
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:2765:374"/> of his troopes, wrought wonders: But SAMSON by his owne force alone, wrought wonders. IOSVE had the ſtrength of many ſoldiers vnder him but SAMSON had it in him, and could alone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme as much, as IOSVE together with many ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Holy loue is excellent in both theſe wayes: for finding ſome vertues in a ſoule (and ordinarily it finds at leaſt Faith, Hope, and Penance) it quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, commands, and happily imployes them in God's ſeruice: and for the reſt of the vertues which it finds not, it performes their worke all alone, hauing more ſtrength alone, then they haue all together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The great Apoſtle doth not onely ſaie, that Charitie giues vs Patience, Benignitie, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Simplicitie: but he ſaieth, that Charitie it ſelfe is patient, benigne, conſtant: And it is the propertie of the ſupreame vertues amongſt men and Angels, not onely to direct the inferiour ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in their operations, but alſo to be able them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeues to doe what they command others. The Bishope giues the charge of all the Eccleſiaſticall functions; to open the Church, to reade, exerciſe, preach, baptize, ſacrifice, communicate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue therein; and he himſelfe alſo ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe, and doth all this, hauing in himſelfe an eminent vertue which comprehends all the inferiour vertues. So S. THOMAS, vpon that which S. PAVLE aſſures vs, to wit, that Charitie is patient, benigne, ſtrong; Charitie ſaieth he, doth doe and accomplish the works of all the vertues. And S. AMBROSE wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to DEMETRIAS, cals Patience and the reſt of the vertues, members of Charitie. And the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:2765:375"/> S. AVGVSTINE ſaieth, that the Loue of GOD comprehends all the vertues, and doth all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations in vs: heare his words, That we ſaie that vertue is deuided into foure, (he meanes the foure Cardinall vertues) we ſaie it, in my opinion, by reaſon of the diuers affections which proceede from Loue. So that I would make no doubt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine thoſe foure vertues thus: Temperance is a Loue which giues it ſelfe entirely vnto God: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is a Loue which doth willingly ſupport all things for Gods ſake: Iuſtice is a Force which ſerues God onely, and therefore diſpoſeth iuſtly of all that belong vnto man: Prudence is a Loue that makes choice of things proper to vnite it ſelfe vnto God, and reiect ſuch things as are contrarie to it. He therefore that hath Charitie, hath his ſoule inueſted with a faire wedding garment, which like vnto that of IOSEPH, is wrought with the varietie of vertues: or rather it hath a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which containes the vertue of all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the perfection of all the vertues: whence Charitie is patient and benigne: She is not enuious, but bashfull; she commits no leuities, but is prudent; she is not puffed vp with pride, but is humble; she is not ambitious or diſdainefull, but amiable and affable; she is not eager in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting that which belongs vnto her, but free and condeſcending. She is not irritated but is pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable. She thinkes of no euill, but is gentle; She doth not reioyce in euill, but in the truth, and with the truth; she ſuffers all, she eaſily beleeues all the good which one can tell her, without all headineſſe, contention, or diffidence:
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:2765:375"/> She hath a firme hope of her neighbours good without euer diſtruſting to procure his ſaluation, she ſuſtaines euery thing, expecting in peace that which is promiſed her: And in concluſion, Charitie is that pure inflamed gold, which our Sauiour cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled the Bishope of Laodicea to buy, containing the price of all things, and which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe, and doth all things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. CHaritie is then the band of perfection, ſince in it all the perfections of the ſoule are aſſembled and contained, and without it, one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not onely not haue the full aſſemblie of vertues, but euen not ſo much as the perfection of any one of them. If the cemente and morter which should tie together the ſtones in the wall be awanting, the whole edifice goes to wrake. Were it not for the nerues, muskles, and ſinewes, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die would be entirely defeated: and without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie the vertues can neuer ſtand together. Our Sauiour doth ſtill tie the performance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements to Charitie. He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, ſaieth he, and doth obſerue them, he it is that loues me: He that loues me not, keepes not my C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mmandements. He that loues me, will obſerue my words: which, the diſciple whom our Sauiour loued repeating; he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues the Commandements of God, ſaieth he, the Charitie of God is perfect in him; and this is the Charitie of God, that we keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:2765:376"/> And he that had all vertues, would keepe all the Commandements: for he that loued the vertue of Religion, would keepe the three firſt Commandements: He that had Pietie, would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the fourth: He that had the vertue of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gentleneſſe, would obſerue the fift: by the vertue of Charitie, one would obſerue the ſixt: by Liberalitie, one would auoyd the breach of the ſeauenth: by Truth, one would effect the eight: by frugalitie and puritie, one would obſerue the ninth, and tenth. And if without Charitie we cannot keepe the Commandements, much leſſe can we without her, haue all the other vertues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True it is, one may haue ſome one vertue, and liue ſome ſmall time without offending God, though he want Charitie: But euen as we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee trees rooted out of the ground, growe as it were, yet fadingly, and for a short time; ſo a heart ſeperated from Charitie, may indeede bring forth ſome acts of vertue, but that cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new for any long time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All vertues ſeparated from Charitie are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ſince they are not able without it, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue at their end, which is Beatitude. Bees in their birth, are little groubs and wormes, without feete wings, forme or fashion: in tract of time they change and become little flies; but afterwards waxing ſtrong, and being come to their groth, then they are ſaied to be perfect and accomplish't Bees, as being furnished of all neceſſaries to flie abrode and make honie. Vertues haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, their progreſſe, and their perfection; and I doe not denie but without Charitie, they
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:2765:376"/> may both be borne, and growe, but that they should come to their perfection and beare the name of formed, fashioned, and accomplished vertues, is a worke of Charitie, which giues them the force to flie home to God, to gather vp his mercy, the honie of true merite, and the ſanctification of the heart wherein they are found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Charitie is amongſt the vertues, as the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne amongſt the Starrs, she diſtributs to them all their luſter and Beautie. Faith, Hope, Feare and Penance doe ordinarily come before as Herbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to take vp her Lodging in the ſoule; and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her arriuall they with all the traine of vertues, doe obeye and waite vpon her; and she with her preſence doth animate, adorne and quicken them all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The other vertues, can mutually aide and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one another in their labours and exerciſes: for who ſees not, that Chaſtitie doth call vpon and ſtirre vp ſobrietie; and that obedience doth moue vs to liberalitie, Praier, and humilitie? Now by this communication which they haue amongſt themſelues, they participate one of anothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: for Chaſtitie kept by obedience, hath a double dignitie, its owne, and that of obedience; yea it hath euen more of the dignitie of obedience then of its owne: for, as ARISTOTLE ſaieth, he that robbeth, to th'end he may commite fornication, is more a Fornicatour then a Thiefe, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication was his affection's onely ayme, he made vſe of ſtelth onely as of a paſſage thither: euen ſo he that keepes his chaſtitie through obedience is
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:2765:377"/> more obedient then Chaſt, ſince he makes Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie ſerue obedience: howbeit from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chaſtitie and obedience a perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished vertue cannot iſſue, being they both want their laſt perfection which is Charitie; ſo that if it were poſſible, that all the vertues were put in one man, and that he wanted onely Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, this aſſemblie of vertues, should indeede be a moſt perfect, and compleate bodie in all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as Adams was, when God with his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hand had formed him of the ſlime of the earth: yet should it be a bodie, wanting motion, life and grace, till God breathed into it the breath of life, that is, holy Charitie, without which nothing doth profit vs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the reſt, the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuine Loue is ſo ſoueraigne that it doth perfect all the vertues, and can receiue no perfection from them; no not by obedience it ſelfe which yet is that, which is moſt able to giue perfection to the reſt: For although loue be commanded, and that in louing we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe obedience, yet ſo, that loue drawes not its perfection from obedience, but from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that which it loueth, loue not being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excellent becauſe it is obedient, but becauſe it loues an excellent Goop. Truely in louing we obeye, as alſo in obeying we loue; but that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is ſo extreamely louely, is becauſe it tends to the excellencie of Loue, nor doth its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie conſiſt in this, that in louing we obeye, but in this, that in obeying we loue. So that euen as God is as well the laſt end of all that is good, as the firſt beginning: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo Loue that is the ſource
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:2765:377"/> of euery good affection, is likewiſe the laſt end and perfection therof.</p>

THe auncient SAGES of the world, made of old, glorious diſcourſes in the honour of morall vertues, yea euen in the behalfe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but that which Plutarke obſerued in the Stoicks, is yet more proper for the reſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. We ſee ships, quoth he, which beare famous inſcriptions. Some are called VICTORIE, others THE VALOVROVS, others THE SVNNE, yet are they not for all that, exempt from their ſubiection to the winds and waues: So the Stoicks bragged that they were exempt from paſsions; that they were without Feare, Griefe or Anger; being people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, and vnuariable, yet are they in effect ſubiect to troubles, diſquiets, boiſterouſneſſe and other impertinences.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I beſeech you for Gods loue THEO: what vertues could thoſe people haue, who voluntarily, and of ſet purpoſe ouerthrew all the lawes of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. SENECA wrote a booke againſt Superſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein he reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impietie with a great deale of libertie: But this libertie ſaieth S. AVGVSTINE was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his writings, not in his life, ſince he adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that in affection one should reiect ſuperſtition,
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:2765:378"/> yet practiſe it in action, for marke his words: Which ſuperſtitions the Sage shall obſerue, as commanded by the law, not as gratefull to the Gods. How could they be vertuous, who, as S. AVGVSTINE relates, were of opinion that the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was to kill himſelfe, when he could not, or ought not longer to endure the calamities of this life, and yet would not profeſſe that calamities were miſerable, nor miſeries full of calamities, but maintained that the wiſeman was continually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and his life bleſſed? ô what a bleſſed life, ſaith S. AVGVSTINE, which to flie, we flie to death? If it be bleſſed, why doe you not remaine in it? So that Captaine of the Stoicks (who was ſo greartly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled amongſt thoſe cruell and profane people, for hauing ſlaine himſelfe in Vtica, to auoyd a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which he reputed vnworthy of his life) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with ſo little true vertue, that, as S. AVGVSTINE ſaieth, he did not teſtifie that he had a courage that would eſchew dishonour, but a weake ſoule, which had not the heart, to expect aduerſitie. For if he reputed it a dishonorable thinge to liue vnder Caeſars co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, why had he commanded to hope in Caeſars mercy? why did he not aduiſe his ſonne to die with him, if death were better a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more honorable then life? He killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then, becauſe he either enuyed Caeſar the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to haue power to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, or for that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it a diſgrace to liue vnder a Conquerour that he hated: wherein he may be commended for a ſtout and bigge heart, yet not for a wiſe, vertuous and ſtayed Spirit. The crueltie which is exerciſed out of choler in cold blood, is the moſt cruell of
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:2765:378"/> all: it is the like in deſpaire; for the moſt ſlow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, and reſolute, is the leſt excuſable, and the moſt deſperate. And as for LVCRECIA (that we may not forget the vallour of the leſſe vallourous Sexe) Either she was chaſt, when TARQVINIVS did force and violate her, or she was not: If LVCRECIA was not chaſt, why is the chaſtitie of Lucrecia commended? If Lucrecia were chaſt and vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that occurrence, was it not an vnworthy fact in Lucrecia, to murther the innocent Lucrecia? If she were adulterious, why ſo much extolled? If honeſt, why was she ſlaine I But she dreaded dishonour and reproch from ſuch as might haue thought that the dishonour which she ſuffered by force, while yet she liued had bene willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if she had after daigned to liue. She was afraied the world would iudge that she complied with the ſinne, if that which was villanouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="3">3. Touching the vertues that belong to our neighbours, euen by their lawes they trod them shamefully vnder foote, yea the principall of them, Pietie: For Ariſtotle the greateſt wit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, doth pronounce this moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and violent ſentence. Touching the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that is, the abandoning of children, or their
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:2765:379"/> education, let this be the law: that nothing is to be kept, that is depriued of any member; touching other children, if they be prohibited by the lawes and cuſtomes of the Citie to forſake their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that the numbers of any ones children doe ſo encreaſe on him, that he hath more by halfe then his meanes will keepe, he is to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to procure an aborſement. Seneca, that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned a wiſe man, we kill monſters, ſaieth he, and ſuch of our children, as are manke, weaklings, imperfect, or mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous we reiect and abandone. So that it is not without cauſe, that Tertullian doth reproch the Romans with the expoſing of their children to the mercy of the waters, to the cold, to famine, to dogs, and this alſo not by the extreamitie of want: for as he ſaieth, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Magiſtrats themſelues practiſed this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall crueltie. ô good God, THEO: what kind of vertuous men were theſe? And what was their wiſdome, who taught a wiſdome ſo cruell and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? Alas, ſaied the great Apoſtle, thinking themſelues wiſe, they became ſenſeleſſe, and their foolish heart hath bene darkened, and deliuered vp into a reprobate ſenſe. Ah what a horrour it is, that ſo great a Philoſopher should aduiſe aborſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! It is a forerunning of manſlaughter, ſaieth Tertullian, to hinder a child conceiued to be borne, and S. Ambroſe reprehending the Pagans for this barbarouſneſſe, they depriue by this meanes, ſaieth he, their children of life, before they are yet poſſeſſed of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if the Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue at any time practiſed any vertues, it was moſt ordinarily, in regard of word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:2765:379"/> glorie, and conſequently they had onely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in action, but neither the motiues nor inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion thereof; nor is vertue true vertue, vnleſſe it haue a right intention. The Pagans force was built vpon humane auarice, ſaieth the Councell of Aur: but the ſtrength of Chriſtians is eſtablished by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly charitie: The Pagans vertues, ſaieth S. AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE, were not true, but onely reſembled Truth; as not hauing bene practiſed to their true end, but for pretentions that vanish away. FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRITIVS shall be leſſe punished then CATAZINE, not that he was good, but becauſe this was worſe; Not that FABRITIVS had any true vertues, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not ſo farre diſtant from them. So that the Pagans vertues at the day of Iudgment will be a kind of defence to them, not that they can be ſaued thereby, but that they may be leſſe da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned: one vice was blotted out by another amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, one vice making place to another, without leauing any place at all to vertue. And out of vaine glorie onely, they repreſſed auarice, and many other vices, yea ſometimes through vanitie, they deſpiſed vanitie; wherevpon one of them who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be leaſt vaine, trampled with his feete Plato's finely made bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what doſt thou DIOGENES, ſaied PLATO vnto him? I tread vnder foote Plato's pride, quoth he; It is true, replyed PLATO, thou treadſt vpon it, but with another pride. Whether SENECA was vaine, may be gathered out of his laſt words: for the end crownes the worke, and the laſt houre iudgeth all: ô what vanitie! being at the point of death, he ſaied vnto his friends, that be could not till now ſufficiently thanke them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Doe not you marke, THEO: how his laſt breathing ſtinke of vanitie? It was not the loue of honeſtie, but the loue of honour which pricked forward thoſe wiſe worldlings to the exerciſe of vertue, and indeede their vertues were as different from true vertues, as the honour of honeſtie, and the loue of merite is different from the Loue of reward. Thoſe that ſerue their Prince for their owne intereſt, doe ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their dutie with more ſolicitude, ardour, and feeling; but ſuch as ſerue out of Loue, doe it more nobly, generouſly, and therefore more worthily.</p>

I will eaſily grant, THEO: that CATO had a reſolute courage, and that this reſolutneſſe was laudable in it ſelfe, but he that would make profit of his example, it muſt be in a iuſt and laudable ſubiect, not by ſlaughtering himſelfe but by ſuffering death, when true vertue shall exact it: not by the vanitie of glorie, but by the glorie of veritie: as it happened to our Martyrs, who with inuincible courages, did ſo many miracles of conſtancie and

               <p n="1">1. THe great friend of God ABRAHAM, had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by SARA his principall wife, his moſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deare Iſaac, who alſo, was his onely vniuerſall Heire: and though he had Iſmael by AGAR, and diuers other children by CETVRA his ſeruants and leſſe principall wiues, yet beſtowed he vpon them certaine preſents onely and Legacies, whereby to put them off and diſinherite them, becauſe not being allowed off by his cheife wife, they could not be his ſucceſſours: Now they were not allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, becauſe, as for the children of CETVRA, they were all borne after SARA'S deceaſe; and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:2765:381"/> Iſmael, though his mother Agar, conceiued him by the permiſsion of SARA her Miſtreſſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, perceiuing her ſelfe with child, she deſpiſed her, and brought not forth this child vpon her knees, as Bala brought forth hers vpon Rachel's. THEO: the onely children, that is, the onely acts of holy Charitie are God's Heires, Coheires with IESVS CHRIST; and the children, or the acts of which the other vertues conceiue and bring forth vpon her knees, by her command, or at leaſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the winges and fauour of her preſence: But when morall vertues, yea euen ſupernaturall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, doe produce their actions in the abſence of Charitie, as they doe amongſt Schiſmatikes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S.

For thoſe actions, ſtrayned
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:2765:382"/> in that ſort, with bad intentions, are indeede more vicious then vertuous, hauing onely vertue on their outſide, their interiour belonging to vice, which ſerues them for a motiue, witneſſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, offerings, and other actions of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie.</p>

But furthermore, as the Iſraelits liued pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably in Egipt, during Ioſephs life time and the life time of LEVI, and preſently after the death of LEVI, were tyrannically reduced into ſeruitude, whence the Iewes tooke their Prouerbe. ONE OF THE BROTHERS BEING DECEASED, THE OTHERS ARE OPPRES'T, as it is regiſtred in the Hebrewes great Chronologie, which was published by the learned Archbishop of Aix Gilbert Genebrard whom to his honour I name with conſolation, whoſe ſcholler I was, though an vnprofitable one while he was the king's reader at Paris, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Canticle of Canticles; ſo the merits and and fruits as well of morall as Chriſtian vertues, doe in a moſt ſweete tranquillitie ſubſiſt in the ſoule, while ſacred Charitie liues a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d raignes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but as ſoone as heauenly loue dies, all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and fruits of other vertues doe alſo die vpon it, and theſe are they which the Diuines call DEAD WORKES, for that hauing beene borne aliue vnder charities protection, and as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Iſmael, in Abrahams houſe, they doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards looſe life and the right of inheritance, by the diſobedience and rebellion which proceeded from their mother, the will</p>
               <p n="3">3. O God THEO: what a misfortune it is, if the iuſt man forſake his Iuſtice, and turne to iniquitie,
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:2765:382"/> his workes of iuſtice shall be no longer held in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie; he shall die in this ſinne, ſaieth our Lord in Ezechiel; ſo that mortall ſinne, doth ouerthowe all the merite of vertues: for touching thoſe which are practiſed while ſinne raignes in the ſoule, they are borne ſo dead that they are vnprofitable for euer to the pretentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life euerlaſting; and as for thoſe that were practiſed before the ſinne was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is while ſacred loue liued in the ſoule, their value and merite doth perish and die iuſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> its arriuall, not being able to conſerue life after Charities death who gaue them life. The Lake which profane authours doe commonly call Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalitus, and ſacred authours MARE-MORTVVM, hath ſo heauie a curſe put vpon it, that nothing that is put into it can liue; when the fish of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine doe come neere it, they die, vnleſſe they ſpeedily returne backe againſt the ſtreame: The trees vpon the brims of it, produce nothing aliue and though their fruit be in apparance, and aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew like to the fruits of other countries; howbeit when on puls them, they are found to be skinne and core, being full of aſshes which flie away in the wind. Theſe be the markes of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſinns, for the punishment whereof, this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie which was peopled with three populous Cities was of old conuerted into a pit of filth and corruption; and nothing was deamed better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the miſcheife of ſinne then this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lacke which had its origine from the moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable diſorder that could be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by mans bodie. Sinne therefore, as a dead and mortall ſea, kills all that comes neere it; nothing is found li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:2765:383"/> in the ſoule which it poſſeſſeth, nor all about it. O God, THEO: nothing: for ſinne is not onely a dead worke, but is withall ſo infections and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, that the moſt excellent vertues of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule doe produce no liuing action; And though the actions of ſinners haue oftentimes a great reſemblance with thoſe of the iuſt man, yet are they indeede barkes onely ſtuffed with wind and duſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are truely looked into, and are rewarded of God onely by ſome preſent benefits, which are beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vpon the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids children, yet are they ſuch barkes, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor can be ſo taſted and relished by the Diuine Iuſtice, as to be rewarded with an eternall crowne: they die vpon the trees, and cannot be conſerued in the hand of God, being voyd of true worth, as it is ſaied in the Apocalypſe to the Bishop of Sardis, who was reputed a liuing tree, by reaſon of diuers vertues which he practiſed, and yet dead he was, for that being in ſinne, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were not true liuing fruits, but dead barkes; glorious to the eyes, but no wayes ſauorie to the palate, ſo that we may all caſt out this true voice following the holy Apoſtle; without Charitie, I am nothing, nothing doth profit me: and with S.

               <head>How holy Loue returning into the ſoule, doth reuiue all the works which ſinne had ſlayne. <hi>CHAPTER. XII.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THe works then of a ſinner, while he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of Charitie, are not profitable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life; and therevpon they are called dead works: whereas contrariwiſe the good works of the iuſt man, are ſaied to be liuing: for that the Diuine Loue doth animate and quicken them with its dignitie. And if afterwards they looſe their life and worth by ſinne, they are held to be workes that are deaded, extinguished or mortified onely, but not quite deade, eſpecially in the Elect: for as our Sauiour, ſpeaking of the little Tabitha Iarus his daughter, ſaid she was not dead, but ſlept onely, becauſe she continued dead ſo ſmall a time till she was reſuſcitated, that it ſeemed rather to be a ſleepe then a true death. So the works of the iuſt man, but eſpecially of the elect, who by the commiſsion of ſinne dyeth, are not called dead works, but onely deaded, mortified, ſtounded or put into a trance, becauſe, vpon the next returne of holy Loue, they either ought, or at leaſt may reuiue and returne to life againe. Sinn's returne, depriues the ſoule and all her workes of life; the returne of Grace doth reſtore life to the ſoule and all her actions. A sharpe winter doth dead all the
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:2765:384"/> plants of the fields, ſo that if it continued ſtill, they would ſtill continew in the ſtate of death. Sinne, the ſad and daunting winter of the ſoule, doth quayle all the holy workes that it finds there in, and if it did alwayes continew, neuer would any thing recouer either life or vigour. But as in the returne of the pleaſant ſpring, not onely the ſeedes which are ſowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the helpe of this delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fruitfull ſeaſon, doe gratefully bud and bloſſome, euery one in his kind, but euen the old plants, which the rigour of the winter paſt had bitten, withered and deaded, waxe greene, and doe reſume new force, vertue and life. So ſinne being blotted out, and the grace of Diuine Loue returning into the ſoule, the new affections, which this ſpring of grace doth bring, doe bloſſome, and bring forth ample merites and bleſsings; but the works that are dried vp, and withered by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the winter of ſinns ouer paſſed, as being deliuered from their mortall enemye, reſume their force, waxe ſtrong, and as riſen from the dead, they florish a new, and ſtore vp merits for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Such is the omnipotencie of Diuine Loue, or the Loue of the Diuine omnipotencie. If the impious turne away himſelfe from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie and shall doe iudgement and iuſtice, he shall viuificate his ſoule; conuert and doe penance for all your iniquities, and iniquitie shall not be a ruine vnto you, ſaieth our Lord. And what is that, iniquitie shall not be a ruine vnto you, but that the ruine which it made shall be repaired? So beſides a thouſand courtiſies that the prodigall ſonne receiued at his Fathers hands, he was reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:2765:384"/> euen with aduantage in all his ornaments, graces, fauours, and dignities which he had loſt. And IOB that innocent picture of a penitent ſinner did in the end receiue the double of that which he had. Verily it is the Councell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deſire, that we should encourage the penitents that are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into fauour with God allmightie, in theſe words of the Apoſtle. Abound in euery good worke, knowing that your labour is not vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in our Lord; for God is not vniuſt to forget your worke, and the Loue which you haue show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in his name. God then doth not forget the works of thoſe, who by ſinne hauing loſt loue, recouers it againe by penance. Now God is ſaied to forget our workes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they looſe their merite and ſanctitie by ſinne committed, and he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers them, when they returne to life and vigour by the preſence of holy Loue. So that amongſt the faithfull, it is not neceſſarie to the reward of their good works, (as well by the encreaſe of grace and future glorie, as by the enioying of life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting in effect) that one fall not into ſinne; but it is ſufficient according to the Councell of Trent, that one depart this life in God's grace and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath promiſed an eternall reward to the works of a iuſt man, but if the iuſt man turne from his iuſtice by ſinne, God will no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the iuſtice and good works which he hath done. But yet if this poore fallen man, doe afterwards riſe and returne into Gods grace by penance, God will thinke no more of his ſinne, and not remembring his ſinne, he will turne mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:2765:385"/> of his former good works, and of the reward which he promiſed them, ſince ſinne, which alone had blotted them out of the diuine memorie is wholy rayſed out, abolished, annihilated: ſo that in that caſe God's Iuſtice doth oblige his Mercy, or rather his Mercy, doth enforce his Iuſtice, to looke a new vpon their precedent good works, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as though he had neuer forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, otherwiſe the ſacred penitent had not dared to ſaie to his Maiſter; render vnto me the ioye of thy ſaluation, and confirme me with thy principall ſpirit; for as you ſee he doth not onely require a newneſſe of heart and ſpirit, but he pretends, to haue the ioye rendred vnto him, which ſinne had bereft him off. Now this ioye is no other thing then the wine of heauenly Loue which doth reioyce mans heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It fares not alike with ſinne in this behalfe, as with the workes of charitie: for the iuſt mans workes are not blotted out, abolished, or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated by the commiſsion of ſinne, but are onely forgotten: marry the ſinnes of the wicked are not onely forgotten but are euen rayſed out, clenged abolished, and annihilated by holy pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the ſinne that is committed by the iuſt man, doth not cauſe the ſinne that was once pardoned, to liue againe, becauſe it was entirely annihilated: But when loue returnes into the penitent ſoule, it makes her former good works returne to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, becauſe they were not abolished but onely forgotten. And this obliuion of the works of the iuſt man who hath forſaken his iuſtice and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, conſiſteth in this, that it made them vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:2765:385"/> while ſinne made him vncapable of eternal life, which is their fruit; and therefore as ſoone as by the returne of Charitie, he is rancked againe with the childen of God, and thereby made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of immortall glorie, God recals to mind his auncient good works, and they become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine fruitfull. It were not reaſonable that ſinne should haue as much power ouer Charitie, as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hath againſt ſinne: For ſinne is an iſſue of our infirmitie, Charitie proceedes from God's power. If ſinne abound in malice to ruinate vs, Grace doth ſuperabound to worke the reparation: and God's Mercy, by which he blots out ſinne, doth rayſe it ſelfe continually, and becomes gloriouſly triumphant ouer the rigour of Iudgement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God had forgotten the good workes which went before ſinne. In this ſort, in the corporall cures which our Sauiour did by miracle, he did not onely reſtore health, but withall added new benedictions, making the cure farre paſſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſo bountifull is he to man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I neuer ſaw, red, nor heard that waſpes, oxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, flies, and ſuch other little hurtfull creatures, being once dead, did reuiue and returne to life, againe; but that the vertuous and harmeleſſe honie Bee can riſe againe, it is a common report, and I haue often red it. It is ſaied, (theſe are Plinies words) that if one keepe the dead bodies of the drowned bees all the winter with in the houſe, and expoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſunne beames the ſpring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, couered ouer with ashes of the figue tree they will riſe againe, and be as good as euer. That iniquities and ſinfull workes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returne to life, after
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:2765:386"/> they haue once bene drowned and abolished by penance, truly my THEO: neuer, for as muche as I know, did the Scripture, or any Diuine ſaie it; yea the contrarie is authoriſed by holy writ, and by the common conſent of Doctours. But that good works, which, like vnto the ſweete Bee, doe compound the honie of merite, being drowned in ſinne, can afterwards regaine life, when couered with the ashes of penance, they are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſunne of grace and Charitie, is held and cleartly taught by all the Diuines: nor are we to doubt but that they become profitable and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as before. When Nabuzardan deſtroyed Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and Iſrael was led in captiuitie, the holy fire of the Altar was hid in a well, where it was turned into mud, but this mud, being drawen out of the well and expoſed to the ſunne, after their returne from Captiuitie, the dead fire kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and the mud was turned into flames. When the iuſt man is made ſlaue to ſinne, all the works of his life, are miſerably forgotten, and turnd into durt, but being deliuered out of Captiuitie, to wit, when by penance, he returnes into grace with heauenly Charitie, his former good works are drawen out of the well of obliuion, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the raves of heauenly mercy, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to life, and are conuerted into as cleare flames as euer, to be ſacrificed on the ſacred Altar of the diuine approbation, and to be reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their wonted dignitie, price, and value.</p>

Now if I pleaſe, I may make a collection of all theſe intentions, and faſt for them all together: But in this caſe, there muſt be good gouernment vſed, to order theſe motiues. For if I faſt rather out of a ſparing humour, then for obedience to the Church: rather that I may ſtudie well, then to pleaſe God: who doth not ſee that I confound right, and order, preferring myne owne intereſt before the obedience due to the Church, or Gods pleaſure? To faſt to ſpare, is good: To faſt to obeye the Church, is better, to faſt to pleaſe God is beſt: and though it ſeeme that of three goods, one cannot compoſe a bad thing; yet he that should diſplace them, preferring the worſe before the better, should without doubt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mite a blame worthy diſorder.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that inuites but one of his friends, doth in no wiſe offend the reſt: but if he inuite them all, and yet giue the greateſt reſpect to the leaſt, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt honorable to the loweſt end, doth he not offend both thoſe and theſe? theſe becauſe he doth depreſſe them againſt reaſon: thoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes fooles of them. So to doe an action for one onely reaſonable motiue, be it neuer ſo little, reaſon is not offended at it; but he that will haue many motiues, he is to ranke them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:2765:388"/> to their qualities, otherwiſe he ſinneth: for diſorder is a ſinne, as ſinne is a diſorder. He that deſires to pleaſe both God and our B.

               <p n="5">5. Now the ſoueraigne motiue of our actions, which is that of heauenly loue, hath this ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne propertie, that being more pure, it makes the action which proceedes from it more pure; ſo that the Angels and Saints of Heauen loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for any other pretention, then for the loue of the Diuine goodneſſe, and with intention to pleaſe. True it is, they exerciſe a moſt ardent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall loue amongſt themſelues, as they alſo loue vs, and the vertues, but all this, purely to pleaſe God. They follow and practiſe vertues not for that they are faire and delightfull, but becauſe they are agreeable to God: They loue their owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, not becauſe it is in them, but for that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God. Yea verily they loue the Loue, with which they loue God; not becauſe it is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for that it tends to God; not becauſe it is guſtfull to themſelues, but becauſe it is pleaſant to God; not becauſe they enioye and poſſeſſe it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God giues it them, and delightes himſelfe in it.</p>

LEt vs ſtriue therefore, THEO: to purifie all our intentions, and ſince we may, if we liſt, grace all the actions of vertue with the ſacred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of Diuine Loue, why shall we not doe it reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, as occaſion requires, all kind of vicious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, as vaine glorie, and proper intereſt? and Let vs conſider all the good motiues, which we may haue to vndertake the preſent action, that we may chooſe the motiue of holy Loue, which is the moſt excellent of all, to water, moiſten all the other with it: for example, if I deſire vallourouſly to expoſe my ſelfe to the danger of warre, I may put it in execution, in conſideration of diuers motiues; for the naturall motiue of this action, is that of ſtrength and vallour, which moues vs reaſonably to vndertake dangerous exploits: yet beſides this I may haue diuers other motiues, as that of obeying the Prince, whom I ſerue; the loue of the common wealth; that of magnanimitie, which makes me delight my ſelfe in the greatneſſe of this action. Now comming to the deede doing, I put my ſelfe vpon the foreſeene perill, for all theſe motiues together. But to raiſe them all to the degree of Diuine Loue, and perfectly to purifie them, I will
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:2765:389"/> pronounce in my ſoule from my very heart, ô e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God, who art the moſt deare Loue of my affections, if vallour, obedience to my Prince, Loue of my Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie and magnanimitie were not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto thee, I would neuer follow their motions which now I feele: but whereas theſe vertues are delightfull vnto thee, I embrace this occaſion of putting them in practiſe: and will no otherwiſe ſecond their inſtinct and inclination, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou loueſt, and willeſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſee plainly, THEO: how by this refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our mind, we perfume all thoſe other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues with the odour and ſweeteneſſe of holy Loue, ſince we doe not meerely follow them as they are vertuous motiues, but in qualitie of motiues that are deſired, embraced, beloued, and cherished of God. He that ſteaks wherewithall to be drunke, is more a drunkard then a thiefe, according to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle. And he then that doth practiſe vallour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, loue towards his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to pleaſe God, he is more a Diuine Louer, then either valliant, obedient, good Patriote, or magnanimous, becauſe his whole will in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe doth aime at, and fall vpon the Loue of God making onely vſe of all theſe motiues, to arriue at this end. We are not wont to ſaie, we goe to Lyons, but to Paris, while we paſſe onely by Lions to Paris: nor doe we ſaie we goe to ſinge, but to ſerue God, while we goe not to ſing but to th'end to ſerue God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if it chance that at ſometimes we are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with particular motiues, as for example, if we should loue Chaſtitie, by reaſon of its ſingular
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:2765:389"/> and delightfull puritie, preſently vpon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, we muſt poure out that of holy Loue, in this ſort. ô moſt ſeemely and delicious candour of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, ô how louely thou art, ſith thou art ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the Diuine Goodneſſe; and then turning towards the Almightie. Ah! Lord I demand onely one thing of thee, it is that which I aime at in Chaſtitie to ſee and practiſe thy good pleaſure in it, and the delightes thou takeſt therein. And as often as we ſet vpon the practiſe of any vertue, we muſt eftſons ſaie from our heart, yes eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will doe it, becauſe ſo it was pleaſing vnto thee from all eternitie. In this ſort we are to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our actions with Gods good pleaſure, louing the decorum and beautie of vertues principally, becauſe they are agreeable to God: For my, deare THEO: there are ſome men who impotently affect the beautie of certaine vertues, not onely without louing Charitie, but euen with contempt of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Origin and Tertullian did ſo affect the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Chaſtitie, that in it, they violated the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt lawes of Charitie, the one chooſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adolatrie, rather then to endure an horrible vilanie, whereby the Tyrans ſought to defile his bodie, the other ſeparating himſelfe from the moſt chaſt Catholike church his mother, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Chaſtitie of his wife more according to his owne fantaſie. Who knowes not that there were certaine beggars at Lions who, to extoll beggarie exceſſiuely, turned heretikes, and of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars became vagabund-rogues? who is ignorant of the vanitie of the ENTHOVSIASTES, MESSALIENS, EVCHITISTES, who forſooke Charitie, to brage of
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:2765:390"/> their Praier? And were there not Heretikes, who to exalte charitie towards the poore, depreſſed Charitie towards God, aſcribing mans whole ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to Almes-deedes, as S. Auguſtine doth witeneſſe? Notwithſtanding that the holy Apoſtle cries out, that though a man giue all his goods to the poore, and haue not Charitie, it profits him nothing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God hath planted the Standart of charitie vpon me, ſaieth the ſacred Sunamite. Loue, THEO: is the Standart in the armie of vertues, all of it is ordered to loue, it is the onely colours vnder which our Sauiour, who is the true Generall of the armie, makes them all ſight.

For firſt, Wiſdome, is in effect no other thing, then the loue which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, relisheth and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth, how ſweete a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious God is.

Science, on the other ſide, is no other thing, then the ſame Loue, which keepes vs hard to the knowledge of our ſelues and the creatures, to make vs reaſcend to a more perfect knowledge of the ſeruice which we owe to God. 4. Counſell is alſo Loue, in ſo much, as it makes vs carefull, attentiue, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in chooſing the meanes, proper to ſerue God piouſly. 5. Fortitude is Loue encouraging and animating the heart, to put in execution that which Counſell determined should be done. 6. Pietie is the Loue which doth ſweeten labour, and make vs cordially, agreeably, and with a filiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, imploye our ſelues in things, which pleaſe God, our Father. And 7. to conclud Feare is no other thing then Loue, in ſo much as it doth make vs flie and auoyd that which is diſtaſtfull to the Diuine Maieſtie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So, THEO: Charitie shall be another Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs ladder vnto vs, conſiſting of the ſeauen gifts of the holy Ghoſt, as of ſo many ſacred ſteps by which, Angelicall men shall aſcend from earth to Heauen, to be vnited to the boſome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie; and whereby they shall deſcend from Heauen to earth, to lend a helping hand to their neighbours, to lead them to Heauen. For in aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vpon the firſt ſtep, Feare makes vs forſake euill; vpon the 2. Pietie incites vs to doe good; vpon the 3. Science makes vs decerne the good which we are to doe, and the euill which we
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:2765:391"/> are to flie; vpon the 4. Fortitude doth encourage vs, againſt all the difficulties which occurre in our enterpriſe; vpon the 5. we make choice of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient meanes by Counſell; vpon the 6. we vnite our vnderſtanding to God to behold and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the draughtes of his infinite beautie; and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 7. we ioyne our wills to God to taſte and experienee the ſweeteneſſe of his incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible goodneſſe: for vpon the top of this ladder, God bending towards vs, giues vs the kiſſe of Loue, and makes vs ſucke the ſacred dugges of his delight, better then wine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if after we haue delightfully enioyed theſe fauours of loue, we deſire to returne into the earth, to gaine our neighbour to the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; from the chiefe and higheſt ſtep, where we haue filled our will with an ardent Zeale, and haue perfumed our ſoules with the perfumes of Gods Soueraigne Charitie, we muſt deſcend to the ſecond ſtep, where our vnderſtanding is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glightened with an incomparable light, and makes prouiſion of the moſt excellent grounds and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes, to glorifie the Diuine Beautie and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. From thence we paſſe to the third, where, by the gift of Counſell, we aduiſe by what meanes we may inſtill the guſt, and true eſtimation of the Diuine ſweeteneſſe into our neighbours heart. Vpon the 4. we take heart, by the means of holy Fortitude, to ſurmount the difficulties, which might croſſe this deſigne. Vpon the 5. by the gift of Science we begin to preach, exhorting all men to follow vertue, and flie vice; Vpon the 6. we ſtriue to plant pietie in them, that acknowledging

Such truely is the feare of a ſoule, endowed with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Loue: For she hath ſuch aſſurance in the goodneſſe of her ſpouſe, that she feares not the looſing of him; indeede she is afrayed, that she shall not ſufficiently enioye his diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that ſome occaſion may make him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe though for an onely moment. She is confident enough neuer to diſpleaſe him, but she feares she shall not loue him ſo much as loue requires: Her Loue is too couragious, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the leſt ſuſpicion, of euer falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with him; but she is withall apprehenſiue and fearefull, that she shall not be vnited vnto him, ſo much as she deſires: yea the ſoule doth ſometimes arriue at ſuch a deſire of perfection, that she doth not feare but she shall be ſufficiently v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto him, Loue aſſuring her the continuance thereof: but she feares that this vnion is not ſo pure, ſimple, and attentiue as her Loue makes her wish. It is this admiring Louer, who deſires not

Now the loue of new beginners or appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſes, proceedes from true loue, but from a loue which is as yet ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, feeble, and beginning onely: Filiall feare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from a conſtant and ſolide loue, and which alreadie tends to perfection: but the feare of a Spouſe, ſprings from the excellencie and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Loue alreadie acquired, but as touching ſeruile and mercinarie feares, they proceede not from loue at all, but ordinarily they preceede Loue, and ſerue it as Herbingers, as we haue alreadie ſaied, and are oftentimes very profitable ſeruants.

Euen ſo the Diuine Goodneſſe about to place a great varietie of vertues in mans ſoule, and afterwards to raiſe them with his ſacred Loue, he makes vſe of the needle of ſeruile and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Feare, which commonly doe firſt pricke our hearts.

                  <pb n="731" facs="tcp:2765:394"/> Our great Father ABRAHAM ſent his ſeruant ELIEZER to chooſe a wife for his onely ſonne ISAAC: Eliezer we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and by diuine inſpiration made choice of the faire and chaſt REBECCA whom he carried away with him. But this wittie Damſell forſooke ELIEZER, as ſoone as she met with ISAAC, and being conducted into SARAS chamber, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained his ſpouſe for euer. God doth often ſend ſeruile Feare, as another ELIEZER, (and Eliezer, is interpreted God's aſsiſtance) to treate the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwixt it ſelfe and ſacred Loue. And though the ſoule be brought vnder the conduct of Feare, it is not that Feare meanes to eſpouſe her; for in effect, as ſoone as the ſoule meets with Loue, she vnits herſelfe vnto him, and quits Feare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet as ELIEZER after his returne remained in Iſaac his houſe, at his and Rebeccas ſeruice, ſo Feare hauing led vs to holy Loue, it remaines ſtill with vs, to ſerue both Loue and the louing ſoule as occaſion ſerues. For though the ſoule be iuſt, yet she is oft ſet vpon by extreame temptations, and Loue as couragious as it is hath enough to doe, to ſuſtaine the aſſault by reaſon of the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the place wherein it is, which is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable heart of man, ſubiect to the mutinie of the paſsions. In that caſe therefore THEO: Loue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes Feare in the fight, making vſe of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe the enemie. The braue Prince IONATHAS, going to giue a charge vpon the Phyliſtians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the obſcuritie of the night, would haue his Eſquire with him and thoſe that he killed not, his Eſpire killed. And loue enterpriſing ſome difficult thing, makes not vſe of his proper motiues onely,
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:2765:395"/> but alſo of the motiues of ſeruile and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinarie feare; and the temptations which Loue ouerthrowes not, Feare defeates: If a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Pride, auarice or ſome voluptuous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure make head againſt me; Ah! shall I ſaie, it is poſsible, that for things ſo vaine, my ſoule would quit the grace of her well-beloued? but if this will not ſerue, Loue will call Feare to his aide: ah doſt thou not ſee miſerable heart, that by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding this temptation, the horrible flames of Hell doe waite vpon thee? and that thou looſeſt the eternall inheritance of heauen? a man makes vſe of all things in extreamities: as the ſaied IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATHAS did, when paſſing the sharp Rockes, which were betwixt him and the Phyliſtians he did not onely make vſe of his feete, but as well as he could, ſcrambled, and ramped with his hands. Euen therefore as the Mariners, who lanch out vnder a fauorable gale, and in a fit ſeaſon, doe yet neuer leaue behind them their cables, ankers, and other neceſſaries againſt ſtormes and tempeſts: ſo though the ſeruant of God enioye the ſweete repoſe of holy Loue, he muſt neuer be vnprouided of the Feare of Gods iudgments, to helpe himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the outrages and aſſaults of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: beſids that as the skin of an aple, which in it ſelfe is of ſmall eſtimation, is yet very vſefull for the conſeruation of the aple which it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; ſo ſeruile feare, which in it ſelfe is but of a meane condition in reſpect of Loue, is yet very profitable to its conſeruation, during the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this mortall life. And as he that preſents a Pomegranade, doth onely preſent it in reſpect of
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:2765:395"/> the grains and iuyce contained with in it, and yet giues it in the pille, as a certaine dependance of it; Euen ſo, though the holy Ghoſt, amongſt his ſacred gifts beſtowes a louing Feare vpon the hearts of his friends, that they may feare God in pietie, as their Father and Spouſe, yet doth he alſo adde to that, a mercinarie and ſeruile Feare, as an acceſſarie to the other, which is more excellent: ſo Ioſeph preſenting his Father with many loades of the riches of Egipt, gaue him not onely the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but withall, the aſſes that brought them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now albeit that mercinarie and ſeruile Feare be very neceſſarie for this mortall life, yet is it vnworthy of any part in the immortall, where there shall be an aſſurance voyd of Feare, a Peace without oppoſition, a repoſe free from care; yet shall the ſeruices which this ſeruile and mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Feare made Loue, be there rewarded; ſo that theſe Feares, though as another Moyſes and Aaron they enter not into the LAND OF PROMIS, yet shall their poſteritie and workes enter: and as for a Filiall, and the Feare of Spouſes, they there shall haue their rancke and place, not to cauſe any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or perplexitie in the foule, but to make her admire and reuerence with ſubmiſsion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible maieſtie, of this omnipotent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this Spouſe of glorie.</p>

Lightnings, Thundrings, Thunderbolts, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, Inundations, Earth-quakes, and other ſodaine accidents, doe excite euen the moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote perſon to feare God, and nature preuenting diſcourſe in thoſe occurences, doth driue the heart, the eyes, yea the very hands to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to inuoke the aſſiſtance of the moſt holy Diuinitie, according to the common ſenſe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which is, ſaieth Titus Liuius, that ſuch as ſerue the Almightie, doe proſper and ſuch as contemne him, are afflicted. In the ſtorme which enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gered IONAS, the Marriners were ſtrooke with a great feare, and each of them fell ſodainly a crying to God. They were ignorant ſaieth SAINT HIEROME, of the Truth, yet they knew there was a Prouidence, and beleeued that it was by the iudgment of Heauen, that they were in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the Malteſes, when they ſaw S. PAVLE inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a viper, after he had eſcaped shipwrake, beleeued that it happened by the Diuine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. And indeede Thunders, Stormes Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts are called the Almighties voice by the Pſalmiſt, ſaying further, that they make his words becauſe they Proclame his Feare, and are as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his Iuſtice. And againe, wishing that the
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:2765:396"/> Maieſtie of God would become dreadfull to his enemies; lighten lightening, ſaieth he, and thou shalt diſperſe them: shoote out thyne arrowes and thou shalt deſtroye them: where he termes Thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolts the arrowes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d darts of God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmiſt, Samuels good mother had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſung, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gods enemies would feare hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he would thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Certes PLATO in his GORGIAS, and elſe where, doth witneſſe that there was ſome ſenſe of Feare amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, not onely in regard of the chaſtiments, which the ſoueraigne Iuſtice of God doth practiſe in this world, but alſo in reſpect of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he exerciſeth in the other life, vpon their ſoules that haue incurable ſinnes ſo deeply is the inſtinct of fearing a Deitie engrauen in mans nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But this feare being practiſed by way of a ſodaine motion or naturall feeling, is neither to be commended nor condemned in vs, ſince it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes not from our election: yet is it an effect of a beſt cauſe, and cauſe of a beſt effect; for it comes from the naturall knowledge which God hath giuen vs of his Prouidence, and giues vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what dependance we haue of the ſoueraigne omnipotencie, mouing vs to implore his aide, and being in a faithfull ſoule, it doth much aduance her in goodneſſe. Chriſtians (amidſt the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which Thunder, Tempeſts, and other naturall dangers cauſe in vs) inuoke the ſacred name of IESVS and MARIE, make the ſigne of the Croſſe, proſtrate themſelues before God, and exerciſe many good acts of Faith, Hope, and
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:2765:397"/> Religion. The Glorious SAINT THOMAS of Aquine, being naturally ſubiect to ſtart when it thundered was accuſtomed to ſaie, by way of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatorie Praier the Diuine words, which the Church hath in ſuch eſteeme! THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH. Vpon this feare then Diuine Loue doth make diuers acts of Complacence, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence. I will bleſſe thee ô Lord, for thou art wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully magnified: Let euery one feare thee ô Lord; ô you great ones of the earth, vnderſtand, ſerue our Lord in feare, and reioyce in him with trembling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But there is another feare, that takes it's beginning from Faith, which teacheth vs, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this mortall life, there are punishments dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eternall, or eternally dreadfull, prepared for ſuch, as in this world haue offended the Diuine Maieſtie, without a perfect reconciliation before their deceaſe: That at the houſe of death, the ſoule shall be iudged by a particular Iudgment, and that at the end of the world, all shall riſe and appeare together to be iudged againe in the Vniuerſall Iudgment: For theſe Chriſtian truthes, THEOT: doe ſtrike the hearts of thoſe that doe deeply pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them with an extreeme horrour, and indeede, how could one repreſent vnto himſelfe thoſe eternall honours without foming, and quaking with apprehenſion? Now when theſe feelings doe take ſuch roote in our ſoule, that they driue and banish thence the affection and will to ſinne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the holy Councell of Trent ſpeaketh, they are very wholſome. We haue conceiued thy feare ô Lord, and haue brought forth the Spirit of
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:2765:397"/> Saluation: I ſaie hath it. That is thy wrothfull face tertified vs, and made vs conceiue and bring forth the Spirit of Penance, which is the Spirit of Saluation, ſo did the Pſalmiſt ſaie, my bones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed no peace, but trembled before the face of thy anger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Sauiour who euen came to eſtablish the law of Loue amongſt vs, ceaſeth not to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnto vs this feare; feare him, ſaieth he, who hath power to throw the bodie and ſoule into hell fire: The NINIVITS did penance vpon the threat of their owne ſubuerſion and damnation, and their penance was agreeable to God: to be short, this feare is compriſed amongſt the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, as many aunciant Fathers haue noted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if Feare doe not deterre our will and affection from Sinne truely it is bad, and like to that of the diuells, who ceaſe to doe miſchiefe onely through a feare they haue to be tormented by the Exorciſme, without ceaſing to deſire, and will miſcheife, which is their meditation for euer; Like to that of the miſerable gallie-ſlaue who would euen eate the Captaines heart, though he dares not ſtirre from the Oare leaſt he might be beaten; Like to the Feare of that great old Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-heretike, who confeſſed that he hated God, becauſe he did punish the wicked. Certes he that loues ſinne, and would willingly commit it, maugre Gods will, though in effect he will not commit it onely leaſt he might be damned, hath a horrible and deteſtable feare: for though he haue not the will to come to the execution of ſinne, yet doth
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:2765:398"/> he entertaine the execution of it in his will, ſince he would doe it, if feare withheld him not, and it is as it were by force, that he effectes it not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To this Feare one may adde another, leſſe malicious indeede, yet no leſſe vnprofitable, as was that of the Iudge FELIX who hearing Gods iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſpoken off was ſtroken into amazeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet did he not for all that giue ouer his auarice: and that of BALTASAR, who in ſeeing the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hand, that wrote his condemnation vpon the wall, was ſo aſtonished, that he looked agaſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ioyntes of his backe bone were diſioynted, his knees with shaking dashed one againſt another, nor would he yet doe penance: and to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it to feare euill, vnleſſe by feare, we reſolue to eſchew it?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their Feare then, that doe as ſlaues obſerue the Law of God, to auoyd Hell, is good indeede; but much more noble and deſirable is the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie feare of Chriſtians, who as hirelings doe faithfully labour, yet not principally for any loue they beare their Maiſter, but to be rewarded with the reward promiſed. O that the eye could ſee, that the eare could heare, or that it could enter into the heart of man, what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe that ſerue him! Ah what an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion would one haue to violate Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, leaſt he might looſe thoſe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall rewards! What teares, what ſobbs would one caſt out, when by ſinne one had loſt it! Yet should this Feare be blame worthy, if it contained in it, the excluſion of holy Loue; for he that should
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:2765:398"/> ſaie, I will not ſerue God, for any loue I will haue towards him, but onely to attaine the reward he promiſeth, should commit blaſphemie, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reward, before his Maiſter, the benefit before the Benefactour, the inheritance before the Father, and his owne profit before God almightie, as we haue more amply showen in the ſecond booke.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But finally, when we feare to offend God, not to auoyd the paines of Hell, or the loſe of Heauen, but onely, for that, God being our good Father we owe him honour, reſpect, obedience, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Feare is filiall, becauſe a well borne child doth not obeye his Father in reſpect of the power he hath to punish his diſobedience, or becauſe he might diſinherite him, but purely becauſe he is his Father; In ſuch ſort, that though his Father were old, impotent and poore, he would not ſerue him with leſſe diligence, but rather, as a pious Storke, would aſſiſt him with more care and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Euen as IOSEPH, ſeeing the good man IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his Father, old, in want, and brought vnder his ſcepter, ceaſed not to honour, ſerue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him, with a more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> filiall te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derneſſe, and ſuch as his brothers hauing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notice, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it would euen worke after his death, and therevpon they made vſe of it to obtaine pardon at his hands, ſaying, your Father commanded vs that we should tell you thus from him; I beſeech thee to forget thy brothers crime, and the ſinne and malice which they practiſed againſt thee: which hauing heard, he began to weepe, ſo did his filiall heart melt at the repreſentation of his
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:2765:399"/> deceaſed Fathers wish and will. Such then doe feare God with a filiall affection, as doe feare to diſpleaſe him, purely and ſimply, becauſe he is their moſt ſweete, moſt benigne and moſt louing Father.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Howbeit though this filiall feare be ioyned, mixed, and tempered with the ſeruile feare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, or with the mercinarie Feare of looſing Heauen, it is yet gratefull to God and is called a BEGINNING FEARE, that is a feare of ſuch as are beginners, and Apprentiſes in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of diuine Loue. For as young youthes, at their firſt beginning to ride a horſe when they perceiue him riſe a little high before, doe not onely cleeue cloſe to hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their knees, but doe alſo catch hard hold of the ſaddle bole with their hands, yet after they haue bene a while trayned vp with it, doe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues cloſe together; euen ſo Nouices a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Prentiſes in Gods ſeruice, finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues loſt amidſt the aſſaults which the enemie makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in their beginnings, doe not onely make vſe of filiall, but alſo of mercinarie and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile Feare, and hold themſelues as well as they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they might not fall from their pretentions.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe glorious S. PAVLE ſaieth thus; Now the Fruit of the holy Ghoſt is Charitie
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:2765:399"/> Ioye, Peace, Patience, Benignitie, Goodneſſe, Longanimitie, Mildneſſe, Modeſtie, Faith, Continencie, Chaſtitie. But marke, THEO: how this holy Apoſtle showing theſe 12. fruits of the holy Ghoſt, puts them for one onely fruit: for he ſaieth not, the fruits of the holy Ghoſt, are Charitie, Ioye &amp;c. but onely the fruit of the Holy Ghoſt, is Charitie, Ioye. And behold the ſecrete of this manner of ſpeach. The Charitie of God is poured forth into our hearts, by the holy Ghoſt which is giuen vs. Certes Charitie is the onely fruit of the holy Ghoſt, but becauſe this one fruit hath an infinitie of excellent proprieties, the Apoſtle about to repreſent ſome of them, by way of a ſcantling, he ſpeakes of this onely fruit, as of many, by reaſon of the multitude of proprieties which it containes in its vnitie, and ſpeakes againe of all theſe fruits as of one onely, by reaſon of the vnitie, in which it is compriſed in this varietie. So he that should ſaie that the fruit of the vine, is ripe grapes, greene grapes, wine, aqua vitae, the liquour that doth reioyce the heart of man, the drinke that doth comfort the ſtomake, would not ſaie that they were fruits of diuers SPECIES: but onely, that though they be but one onely fruit, yet hath it many different proprieties, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is diuerſly vſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle therefore would ſaie no other thing, but onely, that Charitie is the fruit of the holy Ghoſt, which is ioyfull, peaceable, patient, benigne, good, longanimous, ſweete, faithfull, modeſt, continent, chaſt, that is to ſaie, that the Diuine Loue doth giue vs an inward ioye and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:2765:400"/> together with a great peace of mind, which in aduerſitie is conſerued by Patience, and which makes vs benigne and gracious in ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our neighbour, by a cordiall goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, a goodneſſe which is not variable, but Conſtant and perſeuerant, giuing vs a courage of great extent, by meanes whereof, we become mild, affable and condeſcendant to all, ſupporting their humours and imperfections, and ſtanding perfectly loyall vnto them, teſtifying a ſimplicitie accompanied with confidence, as well in our words as actions, liuing modeſtly and humbly, cutting off all ſuperfluities, and diſorders in meate drinke, apparell, bed, plaie, paſtimes and ſuch other voluptuous deſires by a holy continencie, repreſsing eſpecially the inclinations and ſeditions of the flesh, by a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chaſtitie, ſo that our whole man may be occupied in holy Loue as well inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly by Ioye, Peace, Patience, Longanimitie, Goodneſſe, and Fidelitie, as alſo exteriouſly, by benignitie, mildneſſe, modeſtie, continencie, and Chaſtitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now Charitie is called a fruit in ſo much as it doth delight vs, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſo much as we doe enioye its delicious ſweeteneſſe, as being a true aple of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, gathered from the tree of life, which is the holy Ghoſt, graffed in our humane hearts, and dwelling in vs by his infinite mercy. But when we doe not onely reioyce in this heauenly Loue, and enioye its delicious ſweeteneſſe, but euen place all our glorie therein, as in the crowne of our honour, then it is not a fruit onely delightfull to our palate but it is a beatitude and a moſt wishfull felicitie,
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:2765:400"/> not onely becauſe it aſſures vs the felicitie of the next life, but euen in that it doth enrich vs in this life, with a contentment of an ineſtimable price, a contentement which is ſo ſtrong, that all the waters of tribulation, and the floodes of perſequution cannot extinguish it, yea it is not onely not extinguished, but it waxeth rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt pouertie, is aduanced by abiections, and humiliations, reioyceth in teares, gaines ſtrength by being forſaken by Iuſtice; and by being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the helpe thereof, while begging for it, it is deneyed of all: compaſsion and commiſeration doe recreate it, while it is enuironed with the iniurious and neede: It is delighted in the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all ſorts of ſenſuall and earthly delightes, to obtaine the puritie and cleaneneſſe of heart, the vſe of its valour is to lay a ſleepe warrs, iarrs and diſſentions, and to ſpurne temporall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancements and reputation, by all kinds of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it waxeth ſtrong, and holds, that its true life conſiſteth in dying for the well-beloued. So that in a word, THEO: holy Charitie is a vertue, a Gift, a Fruit, and a Beatitude; as it is a vertue, it makes vs obedient to exteriour inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſells, in the execution whereof, all vertues are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whence Charitie is the VERTVE OF VERTVES.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In qualitie of a gift, Charitie makes vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigable and tractable by interiour inſpirations, which are as Gods ſecreete Commandements and Counſells, in the execution whereof the 7. giftes of the holy Ghoſt are imployed, ſo that Charitie is the GIFT OF GIFTS.

               <p n="1">1. Loue is the life of our heart; and as the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe giues motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the moueable parts
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:2765:401"/> of a cloke, ſo doth Loue giue all the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoule hath: All our affections follow our Loue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it we deſire, we reioyce, we hope, we diſpaire, we feare, we take heart, we hate, we flie, we ſorrow, we fall into choler, we triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe. Doe not we ſee men who haue giuen vp their heart as a prey, to the baſe and abiect Loue of women, that they haue no deſires but according to this Loue, they take no pleaſure but in it, they neither hope nor diſpaire but for this ſubiect, they neither dread nor enterpriſe any thing but for it, they are neither diſguſted with, nor flie from, any thing ſaue that which doth diuert them from, this, they are onely troubled at that which doth depriue them of it, they are neuer angrie but out of iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, neuer glorie but in this infamie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The like may be ſaied, of couetous miſers and glorie-hunters; for they become ſlaues to that which they loue, and haue neither heart in their breaſt, nor ſoule in their hearts, nor affections in their ſoules ſaue onely for this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When therefore Diuine Loue doth raigne in our hearts, it doth in a kinglike manner bring vnder, all the other Loues, and conſequently all the affections thereof, for as much as naturally they follow loue; this done it doth tame ſenſuall Loue, and bringing it to ſubiection, all the ſenſuall paſſions doe follow it. For in a word, this ſacred Loue, is the ſoueraigne water, of which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaied, he that shall drinke of this water shall neuer thirſt. No ſurely, THEO: he that hath Loue in a certaine abundance he shall neither haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, dread, hope, courage, nor ioye, but for
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:2765:402"/> God, and all his motions shall be quieted in this onely celeſtiall Loue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Diuine Loue and ſelfe loue are in our hearts, as IACOB and ESAV in the wombe of RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BECCA; there is a great antipathie and oppoſition betwixt them, and doe continually preſſe on vpon another in the heart. Whereat the poore ſoule giues an outcrie, alas wretch that I am, who will deliuer me out of the bodie of this death, that the onely Loue of God may peaceably raigne in me Howbeit we muſt take courage putting our truſt in our Sauiours word, who promiſeth in comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And as it was ſaied of Rebeccas two children, that the elder should ſerue the younger; ſo was it ordained that of theſe two loues of our heart, the ſenſuall should ſerue the ſpirituall, that is ſelfe-loue should ſerue the Loue of God.</p>

When shall it then be, that ſenſuall loue shall ſerue Diuine Loue? It shall then be, THEO: when armed Loue, being arriued at Zeale, shall by mortification ſubiect our paſsions, but principally when aboue in heauen, Bleſſed Loue shall poſſeſſe our whole ſoule in peace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now the meanes whereby Diuine Loue is to ſubiect the ſenſuall appetite, is like to that which IACOB vſed, when for a good preſage and beginning of that which was afterwards to come to paſſe, ESAV co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of his mothers wombe, IACOB held him by the foote as it were to trample vpon, to ſuppliant, and keepe him vnder, or as they ſaie, to keepe him tyed by the foote, after the manner of a Hauke, ſuch as ESAV was in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of a hunter, and as he was a fierce man: For ſo holy Loue, perceiuing ſome paſsion or naturall affection to riſe in vs, muſt preſently catch it by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If any vaine hope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe vnto me, my way of reſiſtance may be, by oppoſing vnto it this iuſt diſcouragement, O ſenſeleſſe man vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doſt thou build this hope? doſt thou not ſee that the great one to whom thou doſt aſpire, is as neere to his graue as thy ſelfe? Doſt thou not know the inſtabilitie, weakneſſe, and imbecillitie of the ſpirit of man? To day his heart, in whom thy pretentions are, is thyne, to morrow, another carries it away from thee, vpon what then is this hope grounded? Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of reſiſting this hope is, to oppoſe to it another more ſtrong; hope in God, ô my Soule, for it is he that deliuers thy feete out of the ſnares; neuer did any hope in him, and was confounded, throwe thy thoughtes vpon eternall and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things. In like manner, may one fight with riches and temporall delightes, either by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt they merite, or by the deſire of ſuch as are immortall, and by this meanes ſenſuall and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Loue, shall be ruinated by heauenly Loue; either as fire is extinguished by water, by reaſon
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:2765:403"/> of its contrarie qualities, or as it is extinguished by heauenly fire, by meanes of its qualities more ſtrong and predominant.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Our Sauiour makes vſe of both the wayes in his ſpirituall cures. He cured his Diſciples of their wordly Feare, by imprinting in their hearts a Feare of a ſuperiour rancke. Feare not thoſe, ſaied he, who kill the bodie, but feare him, who can throw the bodie and the ſoule into Hell fire: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would another time cure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an abiect ioye, he aſsigned them one more high; doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, quoth he, that the euill ſpirits are vnder you, but that your names are written in Heauen; and himſelfe alſo reiecteth ioye, by ſorrow; woe be to you that laugh, for you shall weepe. Thus then doth the Diuine Loue ſupplant and bring-vnder the affections and paſsions, turning them from the end to which ſelfe loue would ſwaye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and applying them to its ſpirituall pretention. And as rhe rayne-bow touching the hearbe ASPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IATHVS doth depriue it of its owne ſmell, and giues it another farre more excellent; ſo ſacred Loue touching our paſsions takes from them their earthly end, and beſtowes a heauenly one in its place, the appetite of eating is much ſpiritualized, if before the practiſe thereof we put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not to content my palate, nor yet to ſaciate this appetite, that I goe to table, but according to thy Prouidence, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine this bodie which thou haſt giuen me, ſubiect to this miſerie; I Lord, becauſe ſo it was thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If I hope for a friends aſsiſtance, may not I ſaie, the manner of thy eſtablishment of our life,

Is there ſome iuſt occaſion of Feare? It is thy will ô Lord, that I should feare, that I may vſe conuenient meanes to auoyd this inconueniencie, I will doe ſo, ô Lord, ſince ſuch is thy good pleaſure.

And as concerning ſadneſſe, how can it be profitable to holy Charitie, ſeeing that ioye is rancked amongſt the fruits of the holy Ghoſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning vnto Charitie. Howbeit the great Apoſtle ſaieth thus; The ſorrow that is according to God, worketh penance vnto ſaluation that is ſtable, but the ſorrow of the world worketh death: there is then a ſorrow according to God, which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly practiſed either by ſinners in Penance, or by the good, by way of compaſsion for the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miſeries of our neighbours; or by the perfect, in deploring, bemoaning and condoling the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall calamities of ſoules.

They ſaie there is a fish named a ſea-toade, or a ſea-diuell by ſurname, who by mouing and ſtirring the mud, doth trouble the water round about her, to hid her ſelfe in it, as in an amboush, wherein as ſoone as she perceiues the poore little fishes, she falls vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, ſpoyles and deuoures them: whence perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture came the common prouerbe, of fishing in a troubled water.

Wherevpon repreſenting vnto himſelfe the greatneſſe of the paines, toyles and hazards which he was neceſſarily to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe in that behalfe, he ſacrificed himſelfe in ſpirit, to Gods good pleaſure, and dearely kiſsing this his Croſſe, he cryed from the botome of his heart, to the imitation of SAINT ANDREW, I ſalute thee ô precious Croſſe, I ſalute, thee ô bleſſed tribulation; ô holy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction how delightfull thou art, ſince thou didſt iſſue from the louing breaſt, of the eternall Father of mercy, who willed thee from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, and did ordaine thee for my deare people and me!

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. I adde to the ſacrifice of S. CHARLES, that of the great Patriarke Abraham, as a liuely image of the moſt ſtrong and loyall loue, that could be imagined in any creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Certainly he ſacrificed the ſtrongeſt naturall affections that poſſibly he could haue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearing the voice of God which ſaid vnto him, Leaue thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie and thy friends and thy Fathers houſe, and goe into the land which I will shew vnto thee, he preſently departed, and with ſpeede put himſelfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way, without knowing whither he was to goe; the loue of his deare countrie, the delightfull conuerſation of his neere allie, the pleaſures of his Fathers houſe did not ſtagger him, he departs with an ardent boldneſſe, and goes whither it shall pleaſe God to codduct him. What an abnegation, THEO: what renunciation was this? one cannot perfectly Loue God, vnleſſe he forſake the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to momentarie things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this was nothing in reſpect of that which he did afterwards, when being twice called by God, who, ſeeing his promptitude in anſwearing, ſaied vnto him. Take ISAAC thyne onely ſonne: whom thou loueſt, and goe into the Land of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:2765:419"/> where thou shalt offer him in Holocauſt, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the mountaines which I will shew vnto thee; for behold this great man, how he ſodainely departs with his ſo much beloued, and ſo worthy to be beloued Sonne, goes three dayes iorney, comes to the foote of the mountaine, leaues there his ſeruant and aſſe, lodes his ſonne Iſaac with woode neceſſarie to the holocauſt, reſeruing himſelfe to carrie the ſword and fire; and as he aſcends the mountaine, his tender child ſaied vnto him, Father, and he anſwered him, what wouldſt thou child? Looke, ſaied the child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the woode and fire, but where is the victime of the holocauſt? To which his Father replied, God will prouide the victime of the Holocauſt, my child; and in the meane while, they arriued at the top of the deſigned mountaine, where Abraham preſently erected an Altar, lays the woode in order vpon it, binds his Iſaac, and puts him vpon the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Pile; extends his right hand, layes hold of, and drawes out his ſword, lifts vp his arme, and as he was readie to diſpatch the blow, to ſacrifice the child, the Angell cried from aboue, Abraham, Abraham, who anſweres, I am here Lord, and the Angell ſaied vnto him; doe not kill thy ſonne, it is ſufficient, now I know thou feareſt God, and haſt not ſpared thy ſonne for my ſake. Vpon this Iſaac is vntyed, Abraham takes a Rame which he ſound hanging by the hornes in the brambles, and ſacrificed him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEO: he that ſees his neighbours wife to couet her, hath alreadie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="782" facs="tcp:2765:420"/> hath alreadie ſacrificed him in his heart. Behold then, for Gods loue, what a Holocauſt this holy man offered in his heart! an incomparable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, a ſacrifice that one cannot fully eſtimate, nor yet praiſe to the full. O God who is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, which of the two loues was greater, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams, who to pleaſe God, ſacrificed his ſonne ſo amiable, or the childs, who to pleaſe God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſacrificed, and to that end permits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be bound, and extended vpon the woode, and as a tender lambe, peaceably attends deathes blow, from the deare hand of his good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For my part I preferre the Father for his longanimitie: yet dare I with all boldly giue the prize of magnaminitie to the ſonne: For on the one ſide, it is indeede a miracle, yet not ſo great a one, that Abraham alreadie old and accomplished in the ſcience of louing God, and frotified by the late viſion and word of God, should giue this laſt eſſay of loyaltie, and loue, towards a Maiſter whoſe ſweeteneſſe and prouidence he had ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiued and taſted. But to ſee Iſaac in the Spring of his age, as yet a meere Nouice and Appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiſe in the art of louing God, offer himſelfe vpon the onely word of his father, to the ſword and the flame, to become a Holocauſt of obedience to the Diuine will, is a thing that paſſeth all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet of the other ſide, doe you not ſee THEOT: that for the ſpace of three dayes, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham doth toſſe and turne in his ſoule the bitter thought, and reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this sharp ſacrifice. Doe

Doe you not thinke that the ſweeteneſſe of the child carrying the woode vpon his shoulders, and piling it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vpon the Altar, made his fathers bowels melt away with tenderneſſe? ô heart which the Angells admire, and God magnifieth!

When shall we offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, our freewill the onely child of our ſoule? when will it be, that we shall extend and tye it vpon the Altar of thy Croſſe, of thy thornes, of thy lance, that as a little Ewe, it may be a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full victime to thy good pleaſure, to burne and die in the flame, and with the ſword of thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue.</p>
               <p n="7">7. O Freewill of my heart, how good a thing were it for thee to be bound and extended vpon the Croſſe of thy Heauenly Sauiour? How deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thing it is to die to thy ſelfe, to burne for euer a Holocauſt to the Almightie? THEOT: our Freewill is neuer ſo free, as when it is ſlaue, ſubiect to the will of God, nor euer ſo a ſlaue, as when it ſerues our owne will. It neuer hath ſo much life, as when it dies to it ſelfe, nor euer ſo much death, as when it liues to it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We haue freedome to doe good or euill; yet to make choyce of euill, is not to vſe, but to abuſe our freedome. Let vs renounce the accurſed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

I loue IESVS, liue IESVS whom I loue, I loue IESVS, who liueth and raigneth for euer and euen. Amen.</p>
